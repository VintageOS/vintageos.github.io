      target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="ReactOS">ReactOS</a> is a
      project, based in Mordovia, Russian Federation, to create an x86
      32-bit OS compatible with the <a href="/windows.html" target=
      "_self" rel="dofollow" title="Microsoft Windows">Windows NT</a>
      kernel, <a href="/dos.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "Disk Operating System">DOS</a>, <a href="/os2.html" target=
      "_self" rel="dofollow" title="OS/2">OS/2</a> and Java
      subsystems.</p>
      <p>For the past 16 years, ReactOS has remained in alpha. The
      current version 0.4.13 was released on 04/10/2020. According to
      its developing group, this OS is 93.8% complete.</p>
      <p>ReactOS can run older <a href="/windows.html" target="_self"
      rel="dofollow" title="Microsoft Windows">Windows</a> software
      without major glitches. If you get programs from <tt>Application
      Manager</tt> (repository), do not upgrade them to the latest
      version from the vendor's website as they might break the OS.
      Although it reports <a href="/windows.html" target="_self" rel=
      "dofollow" title="Microsoft Windows">NT 5.2</a> (Build 3790 SP 2)
      on FAT32 (not NTFS) it fails to run some newer applications —
      almost a game of trial and error.</p>
      <p>For example, the latest version of Firefox available for this
      build is 48 Extended Support Release (08/24/2016) and 78 ESR
      (latest version, 06/30/2020) would not run. I had to reinstall 48
      ESR to what the installer considered an upgrade the newer version
      of Firefox although it was clearly a downgrade.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately I have not been able to run emulators for any
      video game platforms like SNES (sorry, but if no Zelda, why
      bother) that I have not been able to run due to failure to
      install missing libraries. Maybe I could install <a href=
      "/dos.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "Disk Operating System">DOS</a> versions of these emulators.</p>
      <p>Being a <a href="/windows.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow"
      title="Microsoft Windows">Windows</a> clone, it uses the same
      mentality in naming convention and system variables as <a href=
      "/windows.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "Microsoft Windows">Windows</a>. This meant that I had to change
      the environment variables for <tt>TEMP</tt> and <tt>TMP</tt> to
      <tt>C:\TEMP</tt> (bad habit that I picked up working with
      <a href="/dos.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "Disk Operating System">DOS</a> with <a href="/windows.html"
      target="_self" rel="dofollow" title="Microsoft Windows">Windows
      3.1.1</a>). This way all temporary files (<a href=
      "/dos.html#MaintainHDD" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "Disk Operating System » Maintaining a Hard Drive Running MS-DOS &amp; Windows">junk
      data</a>) are stored in one subdirectory so I can delete them
      quickly. I do the same to every <a href="/windows.html" target=
      "_self" rel="dofollow" title="Microsoft Windows">Windows</a>
      machine that I have worked with ever since.</p>
      <p>Although I have played with ReactOS on and off since 2014
      (around version 0.3.16), ReactOS is clearly not ready for prime
      time. I have never used it as my main OS due to the limitation of
      programs that the OS can run. Do not get me wrong. I have had
      lots of fun with ReactOS even running a game engine, which I
      considered promising. As such, I do not know what else to do with
      it. I do not play with it as much, but I am still curious about
      its capabilities as a <a href="/windows.html" target="_self" rel=
      "dofollow" title="Microsoft Windows">Windows</a> replacement
      especially for older machines — most likely involving, people and
      companies on a tight budget.</p>
      <p>ReactOS relies on Wine for compatibility with the <a href=
      "/windows.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "Microsoft Windows">Windows NT</a> kernel. This is similar to
      what <a href="/unix.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "Unix">Unix</a>-like operating systems do when running a <a href=
      "/windows.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "Microsoft Windows">Windows</a>-only application. This might be
      its weakest point of the OS although it is a quick way to achieve
      the goal of making a drop-in replacement for <a href=
      "/windows.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "Microsoft Windows">Windows</a>.</p>
      <p>Although ReactOS uses Wine, it is not <a href="/unix.html"
      target="_self" rel="dofollow" title="Unix">Unix</a>-like OS. This
      project is, for lack of a better legal expression, a <a href=
      "/windows.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "Microsoft Windows">Windows</a> clone without reusing any of
      Microsoft's proprietary code that could be used in a fairly new
      hardware. To make sure the latter remains true, internal audits
      check the code (mostly C++) constantly. Redistributable packages
      and libraries by Microsoft can be installed on ReactOS.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind that, although ReactOS is a functional OS, it is
      still in <em>alpha</em>. It could still be considered a proof of
      concept, an experiment of sorts. As such, it feels fairly buggy,
      and somewhat outdated. Unless you need to run a program or video
      games) that <a href="/windows.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow"
      title="Microsoft Windows">Windows</a> no longer supports or can
      run, ReactOS might not be for you.</p>
    </article>
    <article role="article">
      <h2 id="Installation">Installing ReactOS:</h2>
      <p>Like most operating systems nowadays, the installation of
      ReactOS is handled by a live <tt>.ISO</tt> that can be burned to
      a USB drive. The installation is similar to that of <a href=
      "/windows.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "Microsoft Windows">Windows</a> including the dialog boxes. I
      installed ReactOS in a VDI as I no longer have a physical
      computer lab at home.</p>
      <p>Although I had installed and used ReactOS many times before,
      version 0.4.13 gave me some issues when using VirtualBox. The
      folks at the forum (chat) helped me troubleshoot the errors I was
      getting — freezing the host computer and being forced to reboot
      it manually. I was advised to select <a href="/windows.html"
      target="_self" rel="dofollow" title="Microsoft Windows">Windows
      2003 (32-bit)</a> using no more than 1 GB of RAM.</p>
      <p>If you decide to use a VDI, you might get errors indicating
      that some drivers are missing. Some of these errors do not tell
      you what is missing and/or needed merely displaying that it needs
      a driver for a <em>system device</em>. If you run ReactOS as the
      sole OS in a computer or shared in a separate partition, you
      might need to manually install AC97 (Audio Codec '97 developed by
      Intel Architecture Labs in 1997, available in the Application
      Manager) for audio and other drivers including your 802.11
      adapter.</p>
