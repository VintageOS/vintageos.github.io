      <h1 id="main">What is so special about construction blocks?</h1>
      <p><a
      href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=6068229"
      target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img
      src="/img/640px-Lego_Color_Bricks.jpg" height="200" width="300"

      Alan Chia &mdash; Lego Color Bricks, CC BY-SA 2.0,
      https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=6068229"></a> I
      have always liked construction blocks. They work in a certain
      order and fail is the order is not followed. I have equated
      computer science with construction blocks since I started playing
      with computers. I am curious about the different instruction sets
      and how to employ each author uses those instruction sets.</p>
      <p>At the same time, block programming uses a similar concept to
      that of construction blocks. Each block contains a package of code
      and the programmer does not need to know what the code is or does.
      For example, MIT developed <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/"
      target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Scratch">Scratch</a> for
      children, in which a child can write a program as if it were a
      flowchart. For example, a block that might be labeled
      <tt>WALK</tt> might have code to make an image (sprite) walk.
      Another might be labeled <tt>STAND</tt>, which might make an image
      stand up. With these two blocks, the child can either make the
      image walk and stand up (most likely the wrong logic) or stand up
      and walk (more appropriate logic) depending on the order of the
      blocks (functions, procedures and other recyclable code), which is
      the principle of object programming. At the same time, this is the
      principle behind building blocks where the position of the
      construction blocks determine the look and/or function of the end
      result.</p>
      <p>The following is simply my opinion of some brands that I have
      bought sets from (<a href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR"
      target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Lego">Lego</a>, <a

      https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=6913599"></a> Made in
      Billund, Denmark, since 1932, <a href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR"
      target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Lego">Lego</a> is the most
      common brand name when it comes to interlocking construction
      blocks. Several companies worldwide have cloned <a
      href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
      title="Lego">Lego</a> blocks for years in an attempt to grab part
      of the market. As such, <a href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR"
      target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Lego">Lego</a> has become
      the benchmark, on which similar building systems are based on.</p>
      <p>The quality of Lego has changed various times. In the late
      1980s, the quality diminished and its blocks did not look as
      polished. This is about the same time that Lego had lost a good
      share of its market. In the early 1990s, the quality returned to
      its former self &mdash; well polished blocks without injection
      molding defects, spots left behind where blocks were attached to
      others or the injector itself. Note that all Lego pieces including
      parts of their minifigures have the Lego name on each stud or
      inside flat pieces.</p>
      <p>Lego models have always come exposed studs. Compared to <a
      href="https://amzn.to/2SWW5cF" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
      title="Cobi">Cobi</a>, Lego models look unfinished. Then again,
      Lego is the industry standard although Lego itself is a clone of
      an older interlock block system &mdash; Kiddicraft, which was
      first released by British company Hilary Page in 1944.</p>
      <p>Lego minifigures (not Duplo or Fabuland figures) were first
      released in 1976 (no movable parts and no face). The minifigures
      that most people know about (with arms, legs, hands and faces)
      were first released in 1978. These minifigures are the most common
      recognized from other brands. Unfortunately Lego minifigures are
      highly cloned although it is illegal as Lego holds the pattern and
      rights worldwide. There are lots of fake Lego models mostly coming
      from China with Lego-like minifigures &mdash; for example, Lepin.
      At the same time, some Chinese vendors even use fake brands
      &mdash; for example, Sembo that uses <em>M&amp;H</em> instead of
      <em>H&amp;M</em> to make people believe that the model is licensed
      by the clothing store.</p>
      <p>The only issue that I find with Lego minifigures is that they
      do not have human proportion. These figures look chunky. Of
      course, it does not help that Lego used the four-stud width for
      all cars for almost four decades, which were proper for the 1976
      two-stud wide minifigures with no arms or legs. Nowadays (finally)
      Lego makes cars wider and more proportionally correct using an
      even number of studs &mdash; usually six or eight studs wide.
      There are also some cars that are nine studs wide, which seems to
      have been adopted from <a href="https://amzn.to/2SWW5cF"
      target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Cobi">Cobi</a> models like
      the <em>Youngtimer Collection</em> and the Maserati licensed
      models. What is interesting in the new design of race cars is that
      it looks too much like <a href="https://amzn.to/3tPB5RC"
      target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Sluban">Sluban</a> or
      perhaps it is the way around.</p>

      originally Dongjin then Daegoo Lucky (1971), then Busan Lucky
      (1972), then PAPA (1984) and now Oxford (1992) &mdash; has
      possibly the closest quality to <a href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR"
      target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Lego">Lego</a> including the
      look and feel of its models. Oxford is the perfect clone. It is my
      understanding that Oxford is licensed to produce its bricks and
      minifigures identical to those of <a
      href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
      title="Lego">Lego</a>. The biggest difference is that Oxford does
      not put its brand name on its pieces.</p>
      <p>There are three model of Oxford minifigures. One model looks
      exactly to <a href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank"
      rel="nofollow" title="Lego">Lego</a> minifigures. Another model
      has slightly round legs and feet. The third model is my favorite
      with articulated knees.</p>
      <p>What makes Oxford highly interesting is the licensing from the
      Republic of Korea (ROK) National Military, <em>Dunkin Donuts</em>,
      <em>Kellogg's Cafe</em> and several others. In the US, Oxford made
      the Kre-O brand name for Hasbro &mdash; in other words, Oxford
      repackaged as Kre-O (2011-17). Since Hasbro pulled the plug on the
      Kre-O line, Oxford as a whole lost its market share in the US.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately buying Oxford models in the US is hard and fairly
      expensive &mdash; about two or three times as much as a similar <a
      href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
      title="Lego">Lego</a> model in the US. The latter is why I have no
      experience with Oxford.</p>

      href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
      title="Lego">Lego</a>-compatible sets with different themes like
      the <em>Power Rangers</em>, <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>
      (<em>TMNT</em>), <em>Masters of the Universe</em>, <em>Call of
      Duty</em> and <em>Halo</em> under the brand name of Mega
      Construx.</p>
      <p>Mega does not have standard minifigures anymore. The older
      model of their minifigures were too close to <a
      href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
      title="Lego">Lego</a> minifigures making a good product look like
      a cheap knockoff. These older minifigures are no longer produced
      to avoid lawsuits as well as bad reputation. The new minifigures
      are rather made according to the theme and license. In other
      words, their minifigures are small versions of the characters that
      they represent. <em>He-Man</em> (<em>Masters of the Universe</em>)
      looks like the actual character from the television series with
      articulated arms and legs.</p>
      <p>Just like <a href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank"

      href="https://amzn.to/2SWW5cF" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
      title="Cobi">Cobi</a>, the Mega brand name is on every piece.</p>
      <p>In 2014, Mega became part of Mattel, which means that these
      building blocks are most likely not made in Canada anymore. In
      2020, Mega partnered with TerraCycle to create plant-based
      plastics (bags and blocks) and recycling them.</p>

      (WW1 and WW2), <em>Youngtimer Collection</em> (European cars
      including those from the Soviet Bloc) and other licensed models
      like Maserati, Fiat, Doctor Who (under the old <em>Character
      Toys</em> brand, 2012) and even the UK military.</p>
      <p>The quality is excellent although the bricks are a bit too
      bright compared to <a href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR"
      target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Lego">Lego</a>. Cobi does
      not only clone <a href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank"
      rel="nofollow" title="Lego">Lego</a> blocks. Cobi also has its own
      block designs, which helps Cobi produce more realistic models.
      Just other vendors, the Cobi brand name is on every piece.</p>
      <p>One major difference between Cobi and <a
      href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
      title="Lego">Lego</a> is that Cobi models usually use flat pieces
      for its exterior. In my opinion, this makes its models cleaner and
      more professional &mdash; an opinion that I had since getting my
      second <a href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank"
      rel="nofollow" title="Lego">Lego</a> in 1980 (#6627). Ironically
      Cobi models are more expensive than those by <a

      rel="nofollow" title="Lego">Lego</a> minifigures made in China
      although based in Colne, England. After the merger, Best-Lock has
      used the Cobi manufacturing process. Strangely enough, the
      Best-Lock website still advertises OEM (original equipment
      manufacturer) pieces and how its products are sold by other
      parties under different names. The latter is fairly confusing
      especially with Darren Toys still selling Best-Lock models.</p>
      <p>Just other vendors, older Cobi figures as well as Best-Lock
      minifigures looked like bad <a href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR"
      target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Lego">Lego</a> imitations.
      Nowadays Cobi minifigures look more human with better proportion,
      molded facial expressions, mouths and even noses. Cobi uses
      different models for the figure heads to display various
      expressions and even bandages in soldiers. These minifigures have
      become my favorites in the past couple of years as they are easy
      on the eyes of children and collectors (adults) alike.</p>

      rel="nofollow" title="Город Мастеров (Gorod Masterov)">Gorod
      Masterov</a> (<em>Город Мастеров</em>), which means <em>City of

      href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
      title="Lego">Lego</a> clone (including minifigures and Duplo) is
      made although bragging of being <em>&quot;developmental
      constructors of European quality&quot;</em> (Feb. 2020) located in
      Moscow, Russian Federation. As per the EAC (<em>Евразийское
      соответствие</em>, Eurasian Conformity) marking on every box, one
      would get the impression that these bricks were made Russia
      (Россия), Belarus (Беларусь), Armenia (Армения), Kazakhstan
      (Казахстан) or Kyrgyzstan (Кыргызстан). The reality is that these
      blocks are made in China (possibly by <a
      href="https://amzn.to/3wdQA8d" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
      title="Qman">Qman</a>, but no big-headed minifigures) and not made
      in Russia (Россия) although the words <em>Сделано в Китае</em> or
      <em>中国制造</em> (<em>Made in China</em>) do not appear on boxes
      from <a href="https://amzn.to/3eYWfZu" target="_blank"
      rel="nofollow" title="Город Мастеров (Gorod Masterov)">Gorod
      Masterov</a>. Some of the bricks are branded with some sort of
      design (not the brand name neither in Cyrillic nor Roman
      characters). Most bricks are not branded although they all seem to
      have the same quality of plastic (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene,
      simply referred to as <em>ABS</em> with formula
      <tt>(C8H8·C4H6·C3H3N)n</tt> where <tt>n</tt> is a variable
      depending on quality and production cost) most likely coming from
      the same factory as <a href="https://amzn.to/3wdQA8d"
      target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Qman">Qman</a> or similar
      vendor.</p>
      <p><a href="https://amzn.to/3eYWfZu" target="_blank"
      rel="nofollow" title="Город Мастеров (Gorod Masterov)">Gorod
      Masterov</a> mostly covers Russian cars and trucks like GAZelle
      (ГАЗе́ль) by GAZ (ГАЗ), Zhiguli (Жигули) an Lada (Лада) by
      AvtoVAZ (АвтоВАЗ), KAMAZ (КАМАЗ) and Ural (Урал) as well as the
      Russian military. By the way, one of my earliest memories (c.
      1974) was riding in my uncle's Lada, which he used as a taxi.</p>
      <p>One thing that I do not like is that minifigures cannot fit in
      some of these models. Some cars and trucks come with one-piece
      hollow truck cabins and full outer shell of some cars. It just
      takes the fun away. Those one-piece cabins come without seats or
      doors and grayed out windshields (not clear plastic). I find this
      fairly deceiving because the boxes show clear windshields and even
      minifigures inside as if the truck cabins were usable. Maybe
      models of KAMAZ or Ural trucks might need this sort one-piece
      cabins to show what these cabins look like in real KAMAZ or Ural
      trucks (same mold for all models per brand, not up to scale with
      the minifigures, fairly unimpressive approach). These models are
      four studs wide just like <a href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR"
      target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Lego">Lego</a> used to do up
      to 1978 &mdash; realistic look, but impractical. <a
      href="https://amzn.to/3eYWfZu" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
      title="Город Мастеров (Gorod Masterov)">Gorod Masterov</a> should
      make the truck cabins in such way that minifigures could fit
      inside or simply larger &mdash; considering the size of the
      minifigure, at least six studs wide. The need for realistic look
      and feel might also be for the outer shell of cars, but at least
      minifigures can be put inside these cars.</p>
      <p>I cannot find these models anywhere, not even in <a
      href="https://amzn.to/33UnfDb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
      title="Amazon">Amazon</a>. The only thing I can speculate is that
      the brand name is adopted from the 1966 Russian movie <a
      href="https://amzn.to/3eYWfZu" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
      title="Город Мастеров (Gorod Masterov)">Город Мастеров</a>, which
      is a children's story that I have not yet watched. As a matter of
      fact, I have not been able to find the movie with English
      subtitles anywhere.</p>
      <p>Just like Gorod Masterov, many companies producing <a
      href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
      title="Lego">Lego</a> clones use non-branded Chinese-made blocks.
      There are also companies that specialize in minifigures that may
      cost anywhere from 75&cent; to $10 &mdash; mostly counterfeit <a
      href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
      title="Lego">Lego</a> minifigures. Therefore any company can sell
      designs without worrying about production cost other than
      packaging including artwork on boxes and instruction sets.</p>

      Canada for the North American market soon after, Russia (with
      Russian text on the cover of the boxes rather than other
      languages), India (probably the second biggest market share
      outside its native China) since 2014 and Malaysia for the Malay
      Peninsula including Singapore since 2019. Sluban promotes itself
      as an educational toy with the slogan <em>&quot;Educational
      Bricks, Smart Kids&quot;</em>.</p>
      <p>Sluban is one of the China vendors of <a
      href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
      title="Lego">Lego</a> clones with the highest quality , yet still
      not the best. Sluban blocks are branded <em>M38</em> (not the
      Sluban brand name, but as the first three characters of every
      single model) are highly polished and have a tight fit. Sluban
      models do not come easily undone that often as other Chinese
      clones, which is a common flaw and complaint especially about
      Lepin, which sells counterfeit <a href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR"
      target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Lego">Lego</a> sets, as well
      as cheaper no-name clones.</p>
      <p>Sluban does not seem to be related to other Chinese
      manufacturers. Maybe this is why Sluban has distribution centers
      worldwide &mdash; Sluban Europe (Netherlands), Sluban North
      America (Canada), Sluban India, Sluban Russia and Sluban Malaysia.
      I point this out because a company like Lepin sells models under
      various brand names like <a href="https://amzn.to/3iH1Q8R"
      target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="CaDA">CaDA</a> or <a

      Sembo, Xingbao and others often branded as <em>ENU</em> as if all
      bricks were done in the factory and/or by parent company. Other
      than Sluban, if I were to get another Chinese model, I would most
      likely choose <a href="https://amzn.to/3iH1Q8R" target="_blank"
      rel="nofollow" title="CaDA">CaDA</a> <em>Initial-D</em> 1:24

      title="Город Мастеров (Gorod Masterov)">Gorod Masterov</a>.
      Nowadays Sluban minifigures are different from most other vendors
      (green truck, now looking like <a href="https://amzn.to/3dSgK99"
      target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Roblox">Roblox R15</a>
      character) giving the brand an independent presence and
      credibility in the market.</p>
      <p>Most if not all Sluban models are fairly cartoonish like <a
      href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
      title="Lego">Lego</a> and other vendors except for the <em>Model
      Bricks</em> line of high-end cars, tanks and airplanes that could
      rival the design quality (not accuracy, not properly scaled) of
      both <a href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank"
      rel="nofollow" title="Lego">Lego</a> (not daring enough, never
      military sets or weapons) and <a href="https://amzn.to/2SWW5cF"
      target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Cobi">Cobi</a> (more
      realistic designs than <a href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR"
      target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Lego">Lego</a>). As such,
      just like <a href="https://amzn.to/2SWW5cF" target="_blank"
      rel="nofollow" title="Cobi">Cobi</a>, Sluban has a large selection
      of military models although scale and details are not necessarily
      accurate. Most Sluban models come with flat pieces for their
      exterior for a cleaner look &mdash; yet not as polished like <a
      href="https://amzn.to/2SWW5cF" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
      title="Cobi">Cobi</a>.</p>
      <p>What I find strange is that Sluban has models in China that are
      not available worldwide. I strongly believe that some of these
      models could sell well in the United States, at least, due to the
      fascination of the Asian culture in this country.</p>
      <p>As a little piece of trivia, the little boy in the Sluban logo
      is named Sluban. From an advertisement and marketing point of
      view, naming the mascot (a bald boy in overalls who plays with
      Sluban models) after the brand name is a smart move. Children
      might identify with Sluban (the character) faster than linking the
      Sluban brand name.</p>
