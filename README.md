[VintageOS](https://vintageos.org/) is the source for information on
different operating systems and also offers computer consulting
services.  This website is completely coded by hand using
[Nano](https://nano-editor.org/),
[Gedit](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit) on
[Linux](https://kernel.org/) and/or
[Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) on
[Windows](https://microsoft.com/en-us/windows/) with help from
[Tidy](http://html-tidy.org/) on [Linux](https://kernel.org/) and
[Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/).

[VintageOS](https://vintageos.org/) covers close to three decades
messing around with technology, breaking and crashing every operating
system that I have gotten my wicked hands on from
[C64](http://vintageos.org/basic.html)
([1984](http://vintageos.org/basic.html)) to
[Linux](http://vintageos.org/linux.html) as well as messing with,
teaching and advocating for source code.
