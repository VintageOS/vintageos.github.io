      <h1 id="main">What is Microsoft Windows?</h1>
      <p id="95A">During the first decade of Microsoft Windows
      (versions 1.01 to 4.00.950A), Windows ran on <a href=
      "/dos.html#MSDOS" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What is Disk Operating System (DOS)?">MS-DOS</a> and was merely
      a glorified shell, not really an OS regardless how many times
      Microsoft says otherwise. For the first ten years, Microsoft
      marketed it as a stand-alone shell, not an OS.</p>
      <p id="95B">With the release of Windows 95B (Windows 4.x running
      on <a href="/dos.html#MSDOS" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What is Disk Operating System (DOS)?">MS-DOS 7.x</a>) in 1996,
      Microsoft marketed Windows as a stand-alone OS.</p>
      <p id="98">Windows 98, 98SE and ME continued with this
      misunderstanding and misconception. For these reasons, many
      people say that 95B and up are real operating systems. Because
      95B and up run on a hidden layer of <a href="/dos.html#MSDOS"
      target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What is Disk Operating System (DOS)?">MS-DOS 7</a>, buried in
      <tt>C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND</tt>, many others (myself included) say
      that Windows 4.x in general is a descent tool, but not a real
      OS.</p>
      <p id="NT3.1">With the release of Windows NT 3.1, Microsoft
      finally dropped the <a href="/dos.html#MSDOS" target="_self" rel=
      "dofollow" title=
      "What is Disk Operating System (DOS)?">MS-DOS</a>-dependent
      Windows 4.x kernel.</p>
      <p id="NT4.0">Windows NT 4.0 and up offered some compatibility
      with 16-bit applications.</p>
      <p id="NT5.1">Windows XP (NT 5.1) offers little to none
      whatsoever. I really do not care about any version past 98SE
      since I stopped using Windows after Windows 2000 (descent
      version) in favor of <a href="/bsd.html" target="_self" rel=
      "dofollow" title=
      "What is Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD)?">PC-BSD</a> (2005)
      and then <a href="/linux.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow"
      title="What is Linux?">Linux</a> soon after (original run in 1999
      and then ever since 2009). As such, this page mostly covers my

      <p id="floppies">For Windows 3.1x and 4.00.950A (Windows 95A,
      first edition), you must first install <a href="/dos.html#MSDOS"
      target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What is Disk Operating System (DOS)?">MS-DOS</a> because they
      are not bundled with <a href="/dos.html#MSDOS" target="_self"

      <p>Windows 4.xx (95 to ME) has <tt>CONFIG.SYS</tt>, a system file

      course, do not save anything there that you need or want to keep.

      <p>The latter creates a virtual disk of 2048 bytes (2 MB)
      assigned as <tt>E:</tt>, which is nothing by today's standards,
      but significant if using an i386 or i486.</p>
      <p>Do not bother installing Windows 1 (1985) or 2 (1987) as they
      are merely useful.</p>
      <p>If you are installing Windows 3.1x, (6 floppies for Windows

      <p>If installing version Windows 95A (1995), get ready for
      twenty-one (21) floppies. For the record, IE is not included. You
      can get any 16-bit web browser on floppies.</p>
    </article>
    <article role="article">
      <h2 id="Installing95B">Installing Windows 95B or Later:</h2>
      <p>If installing Windows 95B (1996) or later, make sure the BIOS
      will read CD-ROM first. Reboot the system with the Windows
      CD-ROM. Once the CD-ROM starts running, watch TV or something
      exciting for the next half an hour or longer. Finally follow the
      last steps of the installation and registration (no way around it
      nowadays).</p>
      <p>The architecture of Windows 4.xx can be FAT32 while <a href=
      "/dos.html#MSDOS" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What is Disk Operating System (DOS)?">MS-DOS</a> is FAT16. Do
      not change the structure of the File Allocation Table (FAT)
      running <tt>C:\WINDOWS\CVT1.EXE</tt>. If you do, you would have
      wasted about an hour of work and possible access to your upper
      memory and extended memory blocks.</p>
      <p>If installing Windows 95B or later from a recovery disk,
      forget everything that you have read so far. Most recovery disks
      do not have the OS with <tt>SETUP.EXE</tt> and all the
      <tt>.CAB</tt> files (as you would buy it in any store). These
      recovery disks are merely disk images with the OS, drivers and
      whatever other junk the manufacturer wants to promote — usually
      as shareware. These recovery disks are also BIOS-locked. This
      means that only an recovery disk from manufacturer <tt>`A`</tt>
      will work with a certain BIOS specified by manufacturer
      <tt>`A`</tt>. Therefore a recovery disk from manufacturer
      <tt>`A`</tt> will most likely not work on a PC from manufacturer
      <tt>`B`</tt> most of the times. Try booting your PC with the
      recovery disk. Most likely the PC will boot to an installation
      program and follow whatever instructions you are given. Every
      manufacturer makes these recovery disks differently. There is no
      way to work around this problem. This is the result of
      Microsoft's Piracy Policy.</p>
      <p>If installing Windows NT 4.0 or later including Windows 2000
      (NT 5.0), XP (NT 5.1 and NT 5.2), 7 (NT 6.1), 8 (NT 6.2), 8.1 (NT
      6.3), 10 (NT 10.0) and 11 (also NT 10), first get a list of what
      hardware is in your PC. At the beginning of the installation,
      there are various questions about hardware. Follow the same steps
      as for <a href="/windows.html#Installation95B" target="_self"
      rel="dofollow" title="What is Microsoft Windows — 95B?">95B</a>,
      but you will not get much of a break. The installation is more
      interactive. Make sure that you select NTFS (New Technology File
      System) instead of FAT32 (File Allocation Table 32-bit) when
      asked for the file format system. NTFS will give you more
      protection and privacy, in a multi-user OS. After you finish
      installing Windows 2000 or later, refer to the <em>Black
      Viper</em> website to know what services (programs running in RAM
      all the time, sometimes without your control and/or interaction;
      referred to as a daemons in <a href="/unix.html" target="_self"
      rel="dofollow" title="What are UNIX® and Unix?">Unix</a>) can be
      stopped and/or disabled.</p>

      <p>If you are still running Windows 3.1x at home or work, Calmira
      is a shell worth trying. It is very good, user-friendly and
      free.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="/img/Calmira_Desktop.gif" height=
      "240" width="320" border="0" class="boxes" alt=

      <p>Calmira requires an i386 microprocessor or higher, Windows
      3.1x, at least 4 MB of RAM, a VGA monitor or better and a mouse,
      of course.</p>
      <p>The new version of Calmira has an installer. Just follow the
      proper instructions. The older versions do not have installers.
      You simply copy the decompressed files to a directory outside
      <tt>C:\WINDOWS</tt> or <tt>C:\DOS</tt>. A good idea is
      <tt>C:\CALMIRA</tt>. At this point, run <tt>CALMIRA.EXE</tt>.</p>
      <pre>
        <!-- *spacer* -->
        C:\CALMIRA\CALMIRA.EXE
      </pre>
      <p>If you want to bypass <tt>PROGRAM MANAGER</tt>
      (<tt>PROGMAN.EXE</tt>) to start, edit <tt>SYSTEM.INI</tt>
      changing <tt>SHELL=PROGMAN.EXE</tt> to
      <tt>SHELL=C:\CALMIRA\CALMIRA.EXE</tt> considering that the latter
      is the correct path for the Calmira executable. It is a good idea
      to back up the original <tt>SYSTEM.INI</tt> first.</p>
      <pre>
        <!-- *spacer* -->
        COPY SYSTEM.INI SYSTEM.BAK
      </pre>
      <p>I installed Calmira on my no-name i386 computer running a
      whopping 40 MHz with 20 MB of RAM that I owned at the time.
      Calmira merely uses 4 KB of RAM.</p>
      <p>It took me under twenty (20) minutes to learn what Calmira can
      and cannot do. As usual, I did not read any instructions because
      <em>"real men do not need instructions"</em> (a joke between my
      best friend and me).</p>

      <p>There are also third-party utilities that handle memory

      <p>When I first started working on this page, not to mention
      <a href="/" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What is an operating system (OS)?">VintageOS</a> as a whole,
      Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, XP and 7 were the newer Microsoft
      technologies. Mobile device versions of Windows were shabby and
      have never acquired a descent market share. Case in point, sales
      of Windows CE and Windows Mobile were nowhere near iPhone
      (<a href="/ios.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=

      <p>my experience with Microsoft's attempt of a mobile device OS
      has been less than exciting. Windows CE was Microsoft's PDA,
      which was a pain to configure its synchronization via a serial
      cable.</p>
      <p>Microsoft's attempt to make a smart phone has included
      acquisitions of Danger Hiptop (Sidekick) and the Lumia division
      from Nokia. Microsoft failed miserably and discontinued these
      attempts in 2017 opting to port its apps to <a href="/ios.html"

      <p>Although I had a Windows Phone for work, I did not care for
      it. My unit was nothing more than a glorified portable FM radio
      with an <tt>.MP3</tt> player and a 4" display. Surprisingly I
      found an app in the Windows Phone Store that I really liked —

      <p>It is said that an OS is as good as its applications (apps, in
      this case). Microsoft Phone has a poor library — hence its weak
      market share. The latter is heavily impacted by limited user
      space. The model that I was using had only 4 GB, which is used by
      apps (all files inaccessible and hidden even when mounted) and
      user files (<tt>\Documents</tt>, <tt>\Downloads</tt>,
      <tt>\Music</tt>, <tt>\Ringtones</tt> and <tt>\Videos</tt>). To
      make matters more annoying, although the unit has a slot for a
      microSD, the card was not seen by Windows Phone unless resetting
      it clearing all user configuration with the card in place.</p>
      <p>Needless to say, Windows Phone is much more difficult (not to
      mention frustrating) to use than <a href="/android.html" target=

      <h2 id="PackageManagers">Package Managers:</h2>
      <p id="winget">Windows now comes with its own package manager —
      <tt>winget</tt>. This means that Windows now offers a facility
      that finds software for installation and updates on any computer
      running Windows, which also installs and updates all dependencies
      (libraries and other programs needed) — commonly referred to as
      packages.</p>
      <pre>
        <!-- *spacer* -->
        winget install python3
      </pre>
      <p ide="Chocolatey">There are third-parties that handle this need
      usually at corporate level. I use the free version of <a href=
      "https://chocolatey.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=
      "Chocolatey">Chocolatey</a> to manage applications and their
      dependencies like run-time environments (if available in the
      vendor's repository) in my Windows machines as have no interest
      to manually check which and when software needs to be updated. I
      am not saying that you should install Chocolatey, but it is
      simple to use specially when you install its GUI or if you like
      to use CLI using the <tt>choco</tt> command.</p>
      <pre>
        <!-- *spacer* -->
        choco install chocolateygui
      </pre>
      <p>Chocolatey handles the installation and all configuration
      while your boss thinks you are the best systems administrator he
      has ever hired. It can even upgrade all applications
      automatically via a scheduled task (<em>cron job</em>) or
      manually.</p>
      <pre>
        <!-- *spacer* -->
        choco upgrade all -y
      </pre>
      <p>Of course, there are other applications in the market that you
      can chose from that handle the same job, but I have not seen
      another for end-users. By the way, I am not getting paid for
      promoting the product. It is just a good idea to bring package
      management into the Windows much too often poorly managed and
      disorganized environment.</p>
      <p>Note that the problem with all package managers is that you
      depend on someone — most likely the vendor creating the package
      and distributing it to the repositories. If a package has not
      been distributed and therefore is not available at the
      repository, the package manager cannot compare versions and offer
      you the new version. I have seen this issue with some Windows
      applications where a vendor fails to produce the package on time
      although relying on the package manager for distribution and
      sales (getting new customers).</p>
