      <h1 id="main">What is BASIC?</h1>
      <h2 id="subtitle">(although not an OS in the modern sense, but a
      complete instruction set nonetheless)</h2>
      <p>BASIC (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) was
      more than an entry-level programming language. It was part of the
      instruction set (not quite an OS) for early home computers like
      the TRS-80 Model III running on <a href="/dos.html" target="_self"
      rel="dofollow" title="Disk Operating System">TRSDOS</a> and
      Commodore 64 (C64) running on the ROM-resident OS named KERNAL
      (misspelling of
      <em>kernel</em>).</p>
      <p>I remember reading lots of books on BASIC and <em>Byte
      Magazine</em> and watching <em>Bits and Bytes</em> (TVOntario) on
      channel 13 (1983). My experience at school was on a TRS-80 Model
      III (1984), on which I coded several programs that no longer exist
      (saved on cassette tape, which was an unreliable medium). At home,
      I spent many hours in front of my C64. This is why, on this page,
      I can only concentrate on my experience of BASIC on C64.</p>
    </article>
    <article role="article">
      <h2 id="C64">Commodore 64:</h2>
      <p>C64 was one of the first computer systems that I ever used and
      the first one I ever owned (1984). I quickly got up hooked into a
      whole new field and style of life &mdash; <em>geekdom</em> &mdash;
      and coding into late hours of the night instead of sleeping. The
      experience of working with KERNAL (the OS), machine language
      (accessing KERNAL) and Commodore BASIC (programming) in its 8-bit
      glory boasting a 1.023 MHz microprocessor and 64 KB of RAM was as
      fun as it could be for any kid in the early 1980's (1984, in my
      case). To make things even more exciting and bringing more curious
      kids (like me at the time) to computer science, C64 was heavily
      used for games and even some music programs thanks to its
      ground-breaking technology based on two chips by MOS Technology
      &mdash; SIC 6581 and VIC-II. Commodore International declared
      bankruptcy and closed shop in 1994.</p>

      <p>In 2011, Commodore USA, LLC, took over the Commodore brand name
      and released updated versions of C64 (C64x) with the same vintage
      (old, obsolete, ancient, historical, <em>retro</em>)
      &quot;breadbox&quot; exterior and VIC 20 (VIC Slim) with their own
      <a href="/linux.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow"
      title="Linux">Linux</a> distribution named Commodore OS. I had not
      been thrilled about any new system and/or other technologies for a
      long time. The whole idea of reviving the C64x had me like a
      little kid before Christmas with a new toy wrapped in front of
      him, but I never bought one. Commodore USA closed shop a little
      after one of its owners died on 2013.</p>
      <p>In 2015, Commodore Business Machines Ltd (UK) took over the
      brand name and marketed mobile phones with the C64 look and feel
      rather than the classic C64 &quot;breadbox&quot; body.</p>
      <p>In 2018, Retro Games Ltd (UK) took over the rights to relive
      the heyday of C64 (1982-85) with <em>The C64 MINI</em> marketed as
      a video game console with 64 built-in games and shipped with its
      own joystick, <em>THEC64</em> like the previous but with a working
      keyboard as well as a stand-alone joystick named <em>THEC64 Micro
      Switch Joystick</em>. The company has also released new version of
      the VIC20. All these machines, except for the stand-alone
      joystick, can also be used to program Commodore BASIC (forked from
      Microsoft BASIC) &mdash; the first programming language that I
      ever learned. If there was ever a computer I was excited about its
      launch, I would say is the C64. I want to get my hands on the new
      C64, but first I want to make sure the new Commondore company will
      last. Needless to say, I am stoked.</p>
      <pre>
        10 INPUT "WHAT'S YOUR NAME?"; NAME$
        20 PRINT "HELLO, "; NAME$;
        30 INPUT ", HOW ARE YOU? (OK/NOT)"; OK$
        40 IF OK$ = "OK" THEN PRINT "GLAD TO HEAR THAT."
        50 IF OK$ &lt;&gt; "OK" THEN PRINT "TOO BAD!"
      </pre>
      <p>Another nostalgia option was Manomio's licensed emulator for
      iOS &mdash; iPhone, iPod and iPad. This emulator was almost as
      good as the original C64, but it was removed from the market
      without notice.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately it has been almost thirty (30) years since I last
      coded my last program for the C64 and I hardly remember how to
      code a quick and dirty (not to mention descent) program (excluding
      the one above), but I would consider it the geekiest purchase I
      have would ever make.</p>
      <p>Of course, if you are merely interested in C64 games, you can
      get a ROM emulator and a handful of ROM images, which may be
      illegal in some areas and/or under special conditions (<a

      <h2 id="Versions">Other Versions of BASIC:</h2>
      <p>There are many versions (dialects) of BASIC. The following is a
      quick list of interpreters in chronological order.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Microsoft BASIC originally released as Altair BASIC for Altair
          8800 (1975)
        </li>
        <li>
          Integer BASIC, also known as Apple BASIC, for Apple I and
          Apple II (1977)
        </li>
        <li>
          Commodore BASIC for PET (1977) to C128 (1985)
        </li>
        <li>
          Color BASIC for TRS-80 CoCo (1980-91)
        </li>
        <li>
          BASIC Programming ROM cartridge (Warren Robinett, 1979),
          replaced with Atari Microsoft BASIC for Atari 8-bit home
          computers sold on floppy and ROM cartridge under the name
          Atari Microsoft BASIC II (Microsoft, 1981-92) IBM BASIC
          available as Cassette BASIC, Disk BASIC and Advanced BASIC
          (BASICA) for IBM 5150 (1981) and Cartridge BASIC for IBM PCjr
          (1984)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </article>
    <article role="article">
      <h2 id="Installation">Installing BASIC:</h2>
      <p>BASIC on i286 and prior machines came burnt to a ROM chip.
      There is no way users could install BASIC. On boot, it loads from
      the built-in ROM to RAM. Later machines would run <a
      href="/dos.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title="Disk
      Operating System">DOS</a> and have BASIC as a stand-alone
      executable like <tt class="console">QBASIC.EXE</tt> (Microsoft
      BASIC), but by no means an OS or similar instruction set.</p>
