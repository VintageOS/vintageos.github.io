      <h1 id="CPM">What is Control Program for Microcomputers
      (CP/M)?</h1>
      <p>CP/M originally stood for <em>Control Program/Monitor</em> and
      then the name was changed to <em>Control Program for
      Microcomputers</em>. It is considered the first OS for
      microcomputers (<em>micros</em>) — in comparison with
      mainframes.</p>

      <p>It was written by Gary Kildall (1942-94) in 1972 for the 4-bit
      i4004 microprocessor — first chipset manufactured by Intel in
      1971, which ran at 740-750 KHz, using Programming Language for
      Microcomputers (PL/M), which was the first high-level language
      that he also wrote. Kildall continued development of CP/M on the
      first ever micro — the Intellec-8 (Intel, 1973) running on an 800
      KHz i8008 (1972-83) with 5 KB of RAM expandable to 16 KB. He then
      started Digital Research, Inc. (DRI or DR) and released the first
      commercial version in 1974 — two years after <a href="/unix.html"
      target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What are UNIX® and Unix?">Unix</a> was released in its native C
      programming language.</p>
      <p>By definition, since CP/M can manage disks, CP/M is a <a href=
      "/dos.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What is Disk Operating System (DOS)?">DOS</a> and it is
      partially compatible with <a href="/dos.html#MSDOS" target=

      <p>The latest release was 3.1 in 1983. Although there has not
      been much development or any at all on the OS, CP/M is not
      considered obsolete thanks to many enthusiasts and its
      newly-adopted <a href="/bsd.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow"
      title=
      "What is Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD)?">BSD</a>-like
      license (<a href="/foss.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow"
      title="What is Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)?">FOSS</a>).
      As such, several developers have worked on new OSs based on CP/M
      like CP/Mish and MicroDOS.</p>
      <p>CP/M was a multi-tasking OS and it offered consoles to run
      individual applications. This was much more advanced compared to
      <a href="/dos.html#MSDOS" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What is Disk Operating System (DOS)?">MS-DOS</a>. Ironically by
      the late 1980s, the latter had taken over the market by selling
      each license per microcomputer sold for $40, while DRI sold each
      license of CP/M-86 for $240 per machine.</p>
      <p>If you would like to play with this OS, you should look into
      CP/M-86 2.2, which had become the industry standard in 1970s, or
      CP/M-86 3.1 — the latest version. Note that, in the CP/M naming
      convention, <em>86</em> refers to x86 chipsets, not the year, and
      <em>3.1</em> is the version of the OS. As such, CP/M-86 3.1 is
      CP/M for x86 version 3.1, which was released in 1983.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="/img/Wordstar_Screenshot.png" height=

      <p>By the way, my only memory of CP/M was using WordStar (Rob
      Barnaby, MicroPro International, 1978-99) to type some biology
      papers in high school in the late 1980s. I never really had a
      chance to use it. I started playing with computers in 1983. I
      went from MOS 6202 (<a href="/kernal.html#C64" target="_self"
      rel="nofollow" title="What is KERNAL — Commodore 64?">C64</a>)
      and Z80 (<a href="/basic.html#TRS80Model3" target="_self" rel=
      "nofollow" title=

      with <a href="/basic.html" target="_self" rel="nofollow" title=
      "What is Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code (BASIC)?">
      BASIC</a> as a stand-alone binary. Needless to say, we were
      interested in programming (taught in school without too much of
      an option) and not hardware configurations.</p>
      <p>If you want to test CP/M-86, you can use an application like
      VirtualBox to mount a CP/M-86 <a href="/others.html#Images"
      target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=

      title="What other operating systems are there — images?">floppy</a>.
      Another way to run CP/M-86 is booting into the <a href=
      "/others.html#Images" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What other operating systems are there — images?">image</a> (for
      example, <tt>X:\IMAGES\CPM86.IMG</tt>, where <tt>X:</tt> is the

      "/others.html#Images" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What other operating systems are there — images?">image</a> and
      <tt>CPM86.IMG</tt> is the name of the <a href=

      <h2 id="Loading">Loading CP/M:</h2>
      <p>In the late 1970s and early 1980s, most <em>micros</em> did
      not come with internal hard drive disks (HDDs). Computers shipped
      with one or two floppy drive disks (FDDs). The secondary FDD to
      avoid switching floppies — for example, one to load applications
      to RAM and second for saving data.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="/img/CPM-86.png" height="240" width=
      "320" border="0" class="boxes" alt=
      "By Digital Research, Inc. — http://hampa.ch/pce/screenshots/index.html, Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=77387751"

      <p>On boot, CP/M would be loaded to RAM from a boot disk (floppy,
      <tt>A:</tt>). The good thing about this practice is that
      customers could boot to CP/M or <a href="/dos.html" target=
      "_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What is Disk Operating System (DOS)?">DOS</a> as needed for the
      job.</p>
      <p>CP/M is divided into Basic Input/Output System (BIOS), the
      Basic Disk Operating System (BDOS), the Console Command Processor
      (CCP) and the Transient Program Area (TPA). The BIOS and BDOS are
      called as one subsystem referred to FDOS — not to be confused
      with <a href="/dos.html#FreeDOS" target="_self" rel="dofollow"
      title=
      "What is Disk Operating System (DOS) — FreeDOS?"><tt>C:\FDOS</tt></a>.
      CCP handles the human interaction with the system via CLI. TPA
      handles all applications loaded to RAM that were called by the
      user via CCP.</p>
      <p>Just like <a href="/dos.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow"
      title="What is Disk Operating System (DOS)?">DOS</a>, CP/M uses
      an <tt>AUTOEXEC.SUB</tt> file similar to a <tt>AUTOEXEC.BAT</tt>
      file. There is a major difference between the two OSs when
      writing the files. You can write and/or edit the

      <h2 id="Installation">Installing CP/M-86:</h2>
      <p>Once prices of hard disk drives (HDDs) dropped enough for most
      customers to afford then, manufacturers started shipping their
      <em>micros</em> with internal HDDs. This meant that OSs like
      CP/M-86 and <a href="/dos.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow"
      title="What is Disk Operating System (DOS)?">DOS</a> could be
      copied (installed) to HDD allowing the <em>micros</em> to boot
      from the HDD.</p><!--
      <p>To install CP/M-86 (x86) on a HDD, you need to perform the
      following steps.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Run <tt>HDMAINT.CMD</tt> (Hard Disk Maintenance).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>On the next screen, select <tt>F1</tt> to go to the next
          menu to decide what to do with the HDD partitioning.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>On the next screen, select <tt>F6</tt> to change (create) a
          partition in the HDD. Note that the bootable partition
          (volume) will be <tt>B:</tt>. CP/M can access up to 16
          volumes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>On the next screen, select <tt>F10</tt> to tell the
          application on what cylinder to start creating the partition.
          If there are no other partitions used by other OSs, the
          default value would be <tt>000</tt>. If you decide to accept
          the default value, once again select <tt>F10</tt>.</p>
        </li>
          <p>On the next screen, the application will ask you for the
          size of the partition in cylinders. The default value would
          depend on the size of the HDD. If you decide to accept the
          default value, once again select <tt>F10</tt>.</p>
        <li>
          <p>On the next screen, select <tt>F2</tt> to change the size
          of the directory with a default value of <tt>1024</tt>. Also
          select <tt>F4</tt> to decide if the system should verify every
          write by reading it back. The default value of the latter is
          that it <tt>will not</tt>. If you prefer to accept the default
          values of both, once again select <tt>F10</tt>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>On the next screen, the application will create the
          partition. Once it is done, select <tt>F9</tt> to
          continue.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>On the next screen, the application will ask you to insert
          the <em>system diskette</em> in order to reload CP/M to RAM.
          Once the floppy is inserted, select <tt>F9</tt> to reload the
          OS from the floppy and start a new session.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>After reloading CP/M-86 to RAM, copy (<tt>PIP.CMD</tt>)
          <tt>CPM.SYS</tt> and <tt>CCPM.SYS</tt> to the new volume (the
          CP/M-86 partition on the HDD). The latter is a Basic Disk
          Operating System (BDOS) function responsible to write to disk
          — <tt>B:</tt> (HHD).</p>
                                        no idea how to copy files to HDD ?
                                        <pre>
                                                <tt>CPM.SYS</tt>
                                                <tt>CCPM.SYS</tt>
                                        </pre>
          <p>Hence any error will display <tt>Bdos Err on B:</tt>. Note
          that BDOS is written as <em>Bdos</em>, which I find really
          strange.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Once again run
          <tt>HDMAINT.CMD</tt>. On the next screen, select <tt>F7</tt>
          to change the partition in the HDD.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>On the next screen, do not make any changes (unless needed)
          and select <tt>F10</tt>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>On the next screen, once again select <tt>F1</tt> to go to
          the next menu where you can tell the application what you want
          to do to the HDD.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>On the next screen, once again select <tt>F4</tt> to go to
          the next menu to partition bootable.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>On the next screen, once again select <tt>F2</tt>.
          ...?
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      -->
      <p>I do not have any experience installing CP/M-86. Since I do
      not have a computer with a FDD anymore, I cannot run a boot disk
      or the various floppies to load the OS (<tt>.DSK</tt>) to RAM. I
      was able to get complete OS <a href="/others.html#Images" target=
      "_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What other operating systems are there — images?">images</a>
      (<tt>.IMG</tt>, not <tt>.ISO</tt>) with CP/M-86 1.0 and 2.0 — the
      release that had become the standard in the industry. Installing
      CP/M-86 properly (floppy after floppy) is still a work in
      progress for me.</p>
