      <h1 id="main">What other operating systems are there?</h1>
      <p>This is the main reason I started <a href="/" target="_self"
      rel="dofollow" title=
      "What is an operating system (OS)?">VintageOS</a> in the first
      place — having fun. I like to experiment with different OSs. I
      have tested and crashed several OSs covered in this website
      including some listed on this page.</p>
      <p>The question is why developers keep making operating systems
      (OSs) to call their own. Maybe out of pure vanity, most
      developers take pride of their programs and/or set of connected
      programs as an OS. To make the development of latter more
      interesting, there are groups and manuals on how to write OSs in
      different languages especially <a href="/assembly.html" target=
      "_self" rel="dofollow" title="What is Assembly?">assembly</a>,
      which I do not speak (understand).</p>
      <p>For the time being, I need to point out that these OSs come in
      all forms and for every taste, size and hardware from the easiest
      to understand to most difficult to use. The following list of
      hobby and/or dedicated OS including <a href=
      "/others.html#Microkernel" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What other operating systems are there — Microkernel?">microkernels</a>
      (<a href="/others.html#Microkernel" target="_self" rel="dofollow"
      title=
      "What other operating systems are there — Microkernel?">µkernels</a>)
      is in alphabetical order — both vintage and cutting-edge, most of
      which I have fully tested and often crashed.</p>
      <article role="article">
        <h2 id="Kernels">Monolithic kernels vs. µkernels:</h2>
        <p>When referring to OSs, a kernel is smallest section of code
        that is considered the OS itself — its brain that manages
        system calls, process management, concurrency (running multiple
        threads of a job without asynchronously), memory management,
        file system and device (hardware) drivers. Kernels are loaded
        completely to RAM and need to run throughout the whole session.
        There are two distinct groups of kernels depending how much
        control the kernel really has.</p>
        <ul>
          <li id="Monolithic">Monolithic kernels have full control of
          system, processes, threads, RAM and device driver management.
          All functions take place inside the kernel. A good example is
          the <a href="/linux.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow"
            title="What is Linux?">Linux</a> kernel, which is the OS
            itself. <a href="/linux.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow"
            title="What is Linux?">Linux</a> distributions
            (<em>distros</em>) are built on top of the kernel.
          </li>
          <li id="Microkernel">Microkernels (µkernels) have the least
          amount of control possible. Usually of file system, device
          drivers and other aspects of the OS are handled outside the
          kernel. A good example include any real-time operating system
          (RTOS) currently in the market, which are small enough to use
          the least amount of RAM — for example, in microcontrollers
          and robotics.</li>
        </ul>
      </article>
      <article role="article">
        <h2 id="Images">Images (discs and floppies):</h2>
        <p>Note that some of OSs covered on the list below are
        available in images small enough to fit in a 1.44 MB floppy
        (usually <tt>.FLP</tt>). These OSs hardly ever come with an
        installer to write the image to a hard drive.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>As such, you can burn the image to a floppy using the
          <tt>dd</tt> command in <a href="/linux.html" target="_self"
          rel="dofollow" title="What is Linux?">Linux</a> or <a href=

            </pre>
          </li>
          <li>You can mount the <tt>.FLP</tt> image to a virtual floppy
          drive using VirtualBox, Bochs or similar product — what I
          have done. Depending on the vendor and the version of the
          product, the instructions at this point will vary. You would
          need to refer to the vendor's documentation for detailed
          instructions.</li>
          <li>You can burn the <tt>.ISO</tt> (if available) to a USB
          drive and boot your computer from it. Depending on the
          computer manufacturer and/or the BIOS developer, the
          procedure to boot to the USB drive will vary. You would need
          to refer to the manufacturer's documentation for detailed
          instructions.
            <pre>
              <!-- *spacer* -->
              dd if=disc_image.iso of=/dev/sdb1
            </pre>
          </li>
          <li>Of course, you can also mount the read-only <tt>.ISO</tt>
          image (if available) using VirtualBox, Bochs or similar
          product if you have no intention of saving any data that you
          05/write to RAM while testing the OS.</li>

              documentation to study and learn from. The MikeOS website

              32 MB of RAM. Syllable recommends at 128 MB for web
              surfing and I really doubt the minimum speed of 60 MHz of
              an i586 will work. Syllable used the AtheOS File System
              (AFS), which was copied after the <a href="/beos.html"

              <p>Symbian was a mobile phone and real-time operating
              system (RTOS) from 1998 to 2013. This OS started as EPOC
              developed by Psion for their personal digital organizer
              (PDA). Most Symbian applications were written using the
              Qt framework, C, C++, Python, Java, Flash Lite, Ruby,
              .NET, web runtime (based on ActiveX) and WebKit for the
              built-in Opera web browser. In my opinion, the
              programming languages used in this OS make it too close
              to <a href="/windows.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow"
              title="What is Microsoft Windows?">Windows</a> and its
              unreliable related technologies. In other words, Symbian
              looked on paper like an unreliable OS.</p>

              is a an x86 64-bit OS that needs at least 512 MB of RAM.
              This OS is often considered one of the strangest and
              possibly the less visually appealing OSs ever created.
              This OS was written by Terry Davis (1969-2018), who had
              been diagnosed with mental illness and who was sure that
              God had asked him to write this OS in a special version
              of C, which Davis named Holy-C, and <a href=
              "/assembly.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
              "What is Assembly?">assembly</a>. Using the OS is
              difficult unless you understand its syntax and
              programming language — a <em>cross</em> between C and C++
              (named CrossC, C+, with only one plus sign).</p>

              things (IoT) OS (Linux Foundation project). My experience
              with this OS could be summarized as an annoyance with a
              poor software library other than a handful of streaming
              services on a Samsung smart TV, which I returned the
              following day. I cannot believe that Samsung uses Tizen
              as the OS to power their TV sets. Samsung CRT TV sets
              were good and robust, but nowadays in the age of smart TV
              sets Samsung made a dumb move. Given the chance, I would
              opt for <a href="/android.html" target="_self" rel=

              more robust than Tizen. As a matter of fact, I replaced

              released on 04/2020. As with most OSs on this list, the
              minimum requirements are low. It needs an i586 and 64 MB
              of RAM to barely run. Of course, as with any other OS or
