[VintageOS](https://vintageos.org/) covers close to three (3) decades
messing around with technology, crashing and hacking every operating
system that I have gotten my wicked hands on from C64 and TRS-80
([1984](https://vintageos.org/basic.html)) to
[Linux](https://vintageos.org/linux.html) as well as messing with,
teaching and advocating for open source.
