      <h1 id="main">What (or rather who) is FRN2000?</h1>
      <p id="1971">My name is Frank(ie) Olvera — better known as
      <tt>FRN2000</tt> (formerly known as <tt>FRN</tt>). The moniker
      <tt>FRN</tt> (actually <tt>FRN$</tt>) came from a program that I
      wrote in <a href="/basic.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow"
      title=
      "What is Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code (BASIC)?">
      BASIC</a> in the summer of 1985 to learn French. <tt>FRN$</tt>
      was the string variable for words in French in the in-line data,
      while <tt>ENG$</tt> was the string variable for words in English.
      Needless to say, I never learned French. (<em>Désolé, je ne parle
      pas français!</em>) I came up with the <tt>2000</tt> part of the
      moniker from the KISS version of <em>2000 Man</em> (Casablanca
      Records, 1979) written by The Rolling Stones (<em>Their Satanic
      Majesties Request</em>, Decca Records, 1967) hence putting
      together my two life-long passions — music and technology. I
      started using the moniker <tt>FRN2000</tt> close to three (3)
      decades ago, with which I have left my <a href=
      "https://duckduckgo.com/?q=frn2000+-fn+-fn2000+-fl2000+-ffn2000+-frn+-raja_frn2000+-frn2000a+-fairing+-edu+-menbam1"
      target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=
      "DuckDuckGo query: frn2000">mark</a> throughout the internet for
      since. I am a 52-year-old vegetarian (not a vegan yet), tattooed
      systems programmer, higher education teacher and father of three
      boys (31, 21 & 15) living in NYC with my wife, my kids and my
      cat.</p>
      <p id="1972">I grew up watching lots of science fiction movies
      and television series, including anime (especially <em>Mazinger
      Z</em> by Kiyoshi Nagai, 1972, the pioneer of the super robot
      sub-genre of manga prior to mecha). Some of my favorite science
      fiction television series and/or movies are (in alphabetical
      order) Batman (starting with the 1966-68 TV series), Doctor Who
      (1963-present) with Tom Baker (as The Doctor, 1974-81; role
      currently played by Jodie Whittaker, first female incarnation)
      and companion K9, James Bond (1962-present), RoboCop (1987), The
      Simpsons (1989-present), Star Wars (the three original movies,
      1977-83), The Twilight Zone (1959-64, 1985-89, 2002-03) and The
      X-Files (original run of the series, 1993-2003).</p>

      <p id="1979">Aside from being a geek, I have also been heavily
      involved in music in various ways, even getting a degree in audio
      engineering (1995). I worked in several radio stations, record
      labels, recording studios and sound reinforcement for live
      events. I grew up listening to Aerosmith, Black Sabbath with Ozzy
      (of course) and Ian Gillan (<em>Born Again</em>, 1983), The
      Clash, KISS (my favorite band growing up; first album ever owned,
      <em>Dynasty</em>, Casablanca Records, 1979), Billy Idol, Judas
      Priest, Metallica (<em>Ride the Lightning</em>, possibly my
      second all-time favorite album, especially the songs <em>Fade to
      Black</em> and <em>Escape</em>), The Doors, The Clash, The
      Ramones, Slayer and many others including some Iberian bands like
      Los Ilegales (Principáu d'Asturies), The Gypsy Kings (France) and
      Albina (France) with Eti "Ishtar" Zach (Israel). As a matter of
      fact, I am always looking for new music to listen to and, as of
      late, I have found many bands across the globe like Korpiklaani
      for Finland, Kontrust (Austria) and ЭЛИЗИУМ (Elysium) from
      Russia.</p>
      <p id="1980">Although a bit off-topic, when I was nine years old,
      I started collecting Lego sets and wished I could design Lego
      sets as an adult.</p>
      <p id="1984">With such a fine line between science and fiction,
      as well as multimedia (music), it is no surprise that I got
      involved in computer systems and now have a bachelors degree in
      computer science (2003). My first computer was a <a href=
      "/kernal.html#C64" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What is KERNAL — Commodore 64?">C64</a> at the age of thirteen
      (1984) and I have gone through various other systems since. I
      have used, played with, abused and had the pleasure of destroying
      every single operating system covered in this website.</p>
      <p id="1986">Since 1986, I have owned several electric guitars
      and other music equipment. I currently own two Hohner blues harps
      (different keys), a 1998 Danelectro 56 U2 re-issue with a
      Pastrami Overdrive effect pedal and a 1992 Rickenbacker 2060. I
      also have an off-brand Les Paul copy (a cheap knock-off junker,
      definitely not designed by the genius of Lester William Polsfuss,
      better known as Les Paul).</p>

      <p id="2003">Since 2003, I have worked at a local government
      agency where I created data dictionaries and other documentation
      for programs coded for three decades for its mainframe running
      <a href="/mvs.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What is Multiple Virtual Storage (MVS)?">z/VM</a> for a data
      warehouse used for an ERP. I also coded source code in JSP with
      Oracle intranet applications using JDeveloper. Surprisingly all
      of sudden, we dropped <a href="/foss.html" target="_self" rel=
      "dofollow" title="Open Source">open source</a> to become a
      Microsoft shop, which I have since considered a horrible mistake.
      I do not care about working with Microsoft technologies and
      related products, but it is a paycheck. I also work as a college
      instructor currently teaching Transact-SQL (Microsoft SQL Server)
      and hopefully moving to MySQL soon as well as doing some <a href=
      "/vosc.php" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "VintageOS Consulting">consultant</a> work (freelancer) whenever
      possible.</p>
      <p id="2008">For the next several years, I studied on my own one
      subject that attracts me most (aside from technology and music)
      is human behavior, not limited to psychology and ethos of the
      individual and masses. Hence I usually read, study and write
      essays of my own. From all possible authors in this field, some
      of my favorites are (in order of interest) Nietzsche, Levinas and
      Kant. As such, I have published two (2) science fiction books, in
      which I include my opinion on religion, sociology, psychology,
      politics, manipulation of the masses like MKUltra, the media,
      science and various technologies.</p>
      <p id="2013">In 2013, I published my first three-part story in a
      single volume — <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2jC8aBP" target=
      "_blank" rel="nofollow" title=
      "Under the Thelian Sky, ISBN 9781494232283, ASIN B00GTQBY04">Under
      the Thelian Sky</a></em> (<a href="http://amzn.to/2jC8aBP"
      target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=

      rel="nofollow" title=
      "Under the Thelian Sky, ISBN 9781494232283, ASIN B00GTQBY04">ISBN
      9781494232283</a>). In my debut, mankind did not originate on
      Earth (Sol 3), but rather on Mars (Sol 4). When Mars (Sol 4)
      could no longer sustain life, mankind had to escape and colonized
      Earth (Sol 3). Many years later, a study was written about the
      survival of mankind in Mars (Sol 4) and its struggle in Earth
      (Sol 3) led by <em>Doctor Ajidan Edejem</em>. We have proved to
      be a species that has survived wars, slavery and other forms of
      abuse. All the while, the government controlled by them wants to
      keep everything quiet and even kill him for telling others about
      the unavoidable doom. Years before the extinction of life in Mars
      (Sol 4), the Thelian society was perfect, yet corrupted. Life was
      easy, yet difficult if you were different. For every good person,
      like <em>Ahila Keinj</em> who found peace in <em>The Faith</em>,
      there were many willing to destroy it all for gain while they
      controlled the fate of many. At the end, an outsider simply known
      as <em>Operative Logger 9C56</em> tries to fight them and stop
      their manipulation of history and mankind.</p>

      second novel — <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2wBoHHt" target=

      is a normal New Yorker who wakes up one morning unsure what had
      happened in his life. He is accused of killing the woman he has
      always loved, but he remembers three possible realities — one
      more different and more ironically normal than the previous.
      Which reality could be true? Has he dreamed these realities, seen
