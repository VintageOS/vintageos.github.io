      BASIC (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) was
      released in 1964 at Dartmouth College. It was originally designed
      as the interactive mainframe time-sharing programming language
      for the Dartmouth Time Sharing System (DTSS) OS by Hungarian John
      Grorge Kemény (Kemény János György, pictured on right) and Thomas
      Eugene Kurtz. The original version of the language was later
      referred to as Dartmouth BASIC.</p>
      <p>For the fiftieth (50th) anniversary of the release of BASIC,
      Dartmouth University released a documentary appropriately called
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYPNjSoDrqw" target=
      "_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Birth of BASIC"><em>Birth of
      BASIC</em></a>. If you want a quick lesson on computer science
      history, I highly recommend it.</p><!--

      <p>For the next three (3) decades or so, BASIC became the <em>de
      facto</em> entry-level language for anyone interested in learning
      how to control computer systems. The updated version was referred
      to a Structured BASIC (SBASIC) in 1975, which became the standard
      by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) referred to
      Standard BASIC in the early 1980s.</p>
      <p>In the late 1970s and throughout 1980s, BASIC was more than
      just an entry-level programming language. In tandem with machine
      language to control the OS that the manufacturer had included,
      BASIC was part of the instruction set for early home computers
      like the <a href="/basic.html#TRS80" target="_self" rel=
      "dofollow" title=
      "Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code (BASIC) » TRS80">
      TRS-80 Model III</a> running on the ROM-resident <a href=
      "/dos.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "Disk Operating System">TRSDOS</a> and the C64 running on
      ROM-resident KERNAL (misspelling of <em>kernel</em>). Most
      importantly, BASIC was the only common factor in personal
      computers (8-bit microcomputers, latest technology at the moment)
      as binaries were not compatible from one manufacturer to
      another.</p>
      <p>By today's standards, the late 1970s and most of the 1980s
      were strange times when the OS of the machine was not as
      important as the manufacturer or the amount of RAM — the more
      RAM, the better. We expected the machine to have a built-in BASIC
      interpreter even when we knew that a BASIC dialect might not be
      compatible with another. At the same time, we were limited to
      what was available in the country or region where we lived.</p>
      <p>For example, vendors and models in the UK were different than
      those in the US hence not sold, available or compatible in the US
      (PAL instead of NTSC, 50 Hz current instead of 60 Hz current).
      Because of the relation between England and the rest of the
      British Commonwealth, these units were also available in other
      countries like Australia and New Zealand.</p>

          peripherals and after-market hardware. Since the CoCo as well
          as its software and its peripherals were made by or solely
          sold at Tandy/RadioShack, there was no need for third-party
          distribution. The only problem was the decision not allowing
          third-parties to develop software for the CoCo, which caused
          the quality of some software not be as popular as it could

          MSX was an attempt to standardize hardware so software
          written for one system (for example, Toshiba) would work for
          another (for example, Hitashi). It was the brainchild of
          Kazuhiko Nishi (ASCII Corporation) and Bill Gates
          (Microsoft). This meant that there was no need for choosing a
          vendor from another with different architectures as software
          and peripherals would work on any MSX <em>micro</em>.</p>
          <p>The common MSX (worldwide, 1983) architecture was based on
          a 3.58 MHz Zilog Z80A, at least 8 KB of RAM (most models

      <p>I remember reading lots of books on BASIC, machine language
      for the 64 and a handful of copies of <em>BYTE</em> magazine as
      well as watching TVOntario's <em>Bits and Bytes</em> on WNET
      (1983). My experience in junior high (middle) school was on a

      front of my C64 writing programs that no longer exist. Saving
      programs on cassettes was an unreliable yet very common at the
      time.</p>
      <p>I never got a chance to play with an <a href=

      The C64 was one of the first computer systems that I ever used
      and the first one I ever owned (spring 1984). I quickly got up
      hooked into a whole new field and style of life —
      <em>geekdom</em> — and coding into late hours of the night
      instead of sleeping. The experience of working with KERNAL (the
      OS), machine language (accessing KERNAL) and Commodore BASIC
      (programming) in its 8-bit glory boasting a 1.023 MHz MOS
      Technology 6510 microprocessor and 64 KB of RAM was as fun as it
      could be for any kid in the early 1980s. To make things even more
      exciting and bringing more curious kids (like me at the time) to
      computer science, the C64 was heavily used for games and even
      some music programs thanks to its ground-breaking technology
      based on two chips by MOS Technology — SIC 6581 and VIC-II.
      Commodore International declared bankruptcy and closed shop in
      1994.</p>
      <p>In 2011, Commodore USA, LLC, took over the Commodore brand
      name and released updated versions of the C64 (C64x) with the
      same vintage (old, obsolete, ancient, historical, <em>retro</em>)
      "breadbox" exterior and VIC 20 (VIC Slim) with their own <a href=
      "/linux.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "Linux">Linux</a> distribution named Commodore OS. I had not been
      thrilled about any new system and/or other technologies for a
      long time. The whole idea of reviving the C64x had me like a
      little kid before Christmas with a new toy wrapped in front of
      him, but I never bought one. Commodore USA closed shop a little
      after one of its owners died on 2013.</p>
      <p>In 2015, Commodore Business Machines Ltd (UK) took over the
      brand name and marketed mobile phones with the C64 look and feel
      rather than the classic C64 "breadbox" body.</p>
      <p>In 2018, Retro Games Ltd (UK) took over the rights to relive
      the heyday of the C64 (1982-85) with <em>The C64 MINI</em>
      marketed as a video game console with 64 built-in games and
      shipped with its own joystick, <em>THEC64</em> like the previous
      but with a working keyboard as well as a stand-alone joystick
      named <em>THEC64 Micro Switch Joystick</em>. The company has also
      released new version of the VIC20. All these machines, except for
      the stand-alone joystick, can also be used to program Commodore
      BASIC (forked from Microsoft BASIC) — the first programming
      language that I ever learned. If there was ever a computer I was
      excited about its launch, I would say is the C64. I want to get
      my hands on the new the C64, but first I want to make sure the
      new Commodore company will last. Needless to say, I am
      stoked.</p>

      <p>Another nostalgia option was Manomio's licensed emulator for

      "_self" rel="dofollow" title="iOS">iPad</a>. This emulator was
      almost as good as the original the C64, but it was removed from
      the market without notice. I think someone might have considered
      it some sort of copyright violation.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately it has been over three (3) decades since I last
      coded my last program for the C64 and I can hardly remember how
      to code a quick and dirty (not to mention descent) program
      (excluding the <a href="/basic.html#OKAY.BAS" target="_self" rel=

      one above</a> — <tt>OKAY.BAS</tt>), but I would consider it the
      <em>geekiest</em> purchase I have would ever make.</p>
      <p>Of course, if you are merely interested in C64 games, you can
      get a ROM emulator and a handful of ROM images, which may be

      <h2 id="Installation">Installing BASIC:</h2>
      <p>BASIC on i286 and prior machines came burnt to a ROM chip.
      There is no way users could install BASIC. On boot, it loads from
      the built-in ROM to RAM. Later machines would run <a href=
      "/dos.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "Disk Operating System">DOS</a> and have BASIC as a stand-alone
      executable like <tt>QBASIC.EXE</tt> (Microsoft BASIC), but by no
      means being the similar instruction set of the late 1970s or
      1980s.</p>
      <p>Nowadays there are newer versions of BASIC that are installed
      as any other program would be on a computer via an executable or
      script. For example, FreeBASIC is available for <a href=
      "/dos.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "Disk Operating System">DOS</a>, <a href="/windows.html" target=
      "_self" rel="dofollow" title="Microsoft Windows">Windows</a> and

      <h2 id="16bit">No More BASIC, 16-Bit Microcomputers:</h2>
      <p>When 16-bit computers became mainstream in the late 1980s,
      BASIC was no longer intertwined with the OS and programming no
      longer was the main purpose of computers. In most OSs, BASIC was
      just reduced as a stand-alone binary like GW-BASIC (numbering
      each line, Microsoft, 1983-88) or QBasic (structured programming,
      Microsoft, 1991-present). Slowly BASIC was removed from OS
      distributions like <a href="/windows.html" target="_self" rel=

      <h2 id="Affair">The BASIC Love Affair with 8-Bit Micros:</h2>
      <p>Most nerds (myself included) who grew up with <em>micros</em>
      (1977-95) love these machines. More than nostalgia, it is a love
      affair. This is the reason why there is a whole market of
      second-hand 8-bit <em>micros</em> and modern hardware that can be
      connected to the old hardware like HDDs and FDD emulators,
      hardware replacement and upgrades to bypass the original like
      sound and video cards, wireless adapters, PAL to NTSC converters
      and such. As a matter of fact, Tandy/RadioShack, Commodore, Atari
      and Sinclair <em>micros</em> (including non-licensed USSR clones)
      are some of the best selling units in the second-hand market
      (eBay, Craigslist, etc.) with prices ranging from $100 to $500
      bare-bones. Even 16-bit <em>micros</em> like the line of
      Commodore Amiga can easily sell from $200 to $1,000. Software,
      original monitors and peripherals can also demand high prices
      depending on manufacturer and rarity. Brand new (never open)
      vintage machines can sell for thousands.</p>
