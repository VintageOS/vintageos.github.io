      (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) was released in
      1964 at Dartmouth College. It was originally designed as the
      interactive mainframe timesharing programming language for the
      Dartmouth Time Sharing System (DTSS) OS by Hungarian John Grorge
      Kem&eacute;ny (Kem&eacute;ny J&aacute;nos Gy&ouml;rgy, pictured on
      right) and Thomas Eugene Kurtz. The original version of the
      language was later referred to as Dartmouth BASIC. For the next
      three (3) decades or so, BASIC became the <em>de facto</em>
      entry-level language for anyone interested in learning how to
      control computer systems. The updated version was referred to a
      Structured BASIC (SBASIC) in 1975, which became the standard by
      the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) referred to
      Standard BASIC in the early 1980s.</p>
      <p>In the late 1970s and throughout 1980s, BASIC was more than
      just an entry-level programming language. In tandem with machine
      language to control the OS that the manufacturer had included,
      BASIC was part of the instruction set for early home computers
      like the <a href="/basic.html#TRS80" target="_self" rel="dofollow"
      title="Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code (BASIC)
      &raquo; TRS80">TRS-80 Model III</a> running on the ROM-resident <a
      href="/dos.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title="Disk
      Operating System">TRSDOS</a> and the C64 running on ROM-resident
      KERNAL (misspelling of <em>kernel</em>). Most importantly, BASIC
      was the only common factor in personal computers (8-bit
      microcomputers, latest technology at the moment) as binaries were
      not compatible from one manufacturer to another.</p>
      <p>By today's standards, the late 1970s and most of the 1980s were
      strange times when the OS of the machine was not as important as
      the manufacturer or the amount of RAM &mdash; the more RAM, the
      better. We expected the machine to have a built-in BASIC
      interpreter even when we knew that a BASIC dialect might not be
      compatible with another. At the same time, we were limited to what
      was available in the country or region where we lived.</p>
      <p>For example, vendors and models in the UK were different than
      those in the US hence not sold, available or compatible in the
      US (PAL instead of NTSC, 50 Hz current instead of 60 Hz current).
      Because of the relation between England and the rest of the
      British Commonwealth, these units were also available in other
      countries like Australia and New Zealand.</p>

      <p>I remember reading lots of books on BASIC, machine language for
      the 64 and a handful of copies of <em>BYTE</em> magazine as well
      as watching TVOntario's <em>Bits and Bytes</em> on WNET (1983). My

      common at the time.</p>

      title="By Evan-Amos - Own work, Public Domain,
      https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=17414886"></a> The
      C64 was one of the first computer systems that I ever used and the
      first one I ever owned (spring 1984). I quickly got up hooked into
      a whole new field and style of life &mdash; <em>geekdom</em>
      &mdash; and coding into late hours of the night instead of
      sleeping. The experience of working with KERNAL (the OS), machine
      language (accessing KERNAL) and Commodore BASIC (programming) in
      its 8-bit glory boasting a 1.023 MHz MOS Technology 6510
      microprocessor and 64 KB of RAM was as fun as it could be for any
      kid in the early 1980s. To make things even more exciting and
      bringing more curious kids (like me at the time) to computer
      science, the C64 was heavily used for games and even some music
      programs thanks to its ground-breaking technology based on two
      chips by MOS Technology &mdash; SIC 6581 and VIC-II. Commodore
      International declared bankruptcy and closed shop in 1994.</p>
      <p>In 2011, Commodore USA, LLC, took over the Commodore brand name
      and released updated versions of the C64 (C64x) with the same
      vintage (old, obsolete, ancient, historical, <em>retro</em>)
      &quot;breadbox&quot; exterior and VIC 20 (VIC Slim) with their own
      <a href="/linux.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow"
      title="Linux">Linux</a> distribution named Commodore OS. I had not
      been thrilled about any new system and/or other technologies for a
      long time. The whole idea of reviving the C64x had me like a
      little kid before Christmas with a new toy wrapped in front of
      him, but I never bought one. Commodore USA closed shop a little
      after one of its owners died on 2013.</p>
      <p>In 2015, Commodore Business Machines Ltd (UK) took over the
      brand name and marketed mobile phones with the C64 look and feel
      rather than the classic C64 &quot;breadbox&quot; body.</p>
      <p>In 2018, Retro Games Ltd (UK) took over the rights to relive
      the heyday of the C64 (1982-85) with <em>The C64 MINI</em>
      marketed as a video game console with 64 built-in games and
      shipped with its own joystick, <em>THEC64</em> like the previous
      but with a working keyboard as well as a stand-alone joystick
      named <em>THEC64 Micro Switch Joystick</em>. The company has also
      released new version of the VIC20. All these machines, except for
      the stand-alone joystick, can also be used to program Commodore
      BASIC (forked from Microsoft BASIC) &mdash; the first programming
      language that I ever learned. If there was ever a computer I was
      excited about its launch, I would say is the C64. I want to get my
      hands on the new the C64, but first I want to make sure the new
      Commondore company will last. Needless to say, I am stoked.</p>

      <p>Another nostalgia option was Manomio's licensed emulator for <a

      target="_self" rel="dofollow" title="iOS">iPad</a>. This emulator
      was almost as good as the original the C64, but it was removed
      from the market without notice. I think someone might have
      considered it some sort of copyright violation.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately it has been over three (3) decades since I last
      coded my last program for the C64 and I can hardly remember how to
      code a quick and dirty (not to mention descent) program (excluding
      the <a href="/basic.html#OKAY.BAS" target="_self" rel="dofollow"

      purchase I have would ever make.</p>
      <p>Of course, if you are merely interested in C64 games, you can
      get a ROM emulator and a handful of ROM images, which may be

          16-bit and multi-tasking OS for the C64 and C128 with optional
          packages for the GUI, shell consoles and internet acceess.
          WiNGs needs a CMD SuperCPU (W65C816S 8/16-bit processor), CMD
          SuperRAM card with at least 1 MB, a CMD HD (if not a CBM 1351
          floppy drive), IDE64 (SD external drive instead of a CMD HD),
          a CBM Mouse 1351 mouse for GUI, a CMD Turbo232 DUART cartridge
          and a Swiftlink or IDE64 DUART full duplex asynchronous
          communication (modem) for internet access (Feb. 2020). WiNGs
          seems to be the most interesting OS in this short list, but
          all this hardware seems a bit too expensive for my taste. If
          you start buying all the extra hardware to operate a C64 as
          modern machine, you might as well get a new computer.</p>

      <p>As I mentioned before, I also have a special memory of the
      TRS-80, specially Model III and the Color Computer 2 (CoCo 2)
      &mdash; not other models of the TRS-80 family. I used a TRS-80 at
      school (two students per machine). I enjoyed annoying others with
      the orange button on the top right hand side of the keyboard
      &mdash; memory flush, similar to the <tt>NEW</tt> command in BASIC
      (Level I BASIC, in this case).</p>

      <p>I never used the CoCo 3, but
      I remember seeing it in Radio Shack stores and thinking that it
      was a sexy machine. As a matter of fact, the CoCo 3 remains as one

      <h2 id="Installation">Installing BASIC:</h2>
      <p>BASIC on i286 and prior machines came burnt to a ROM chip.
      There is no way users could install BASIC. On boot, it loads from
      the built-in ROM to RAM. Later machines would run <a
      href="/dos.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title="Disk
      Operating System">DOS</a> and have BASIC as a stand-alone
      executable like <tt>QBASIC.EXE</tt> (Microsoft BASIC), but by no
      means being the similar instruction set of the late 1970s or
      1980s.</p>
      <p>Nowadays there are newer versions of BASIC that are installed
      as any other program would be on a computer via an excutable or
      script. For example, FreeBASIC is available for <a
      href="/dos.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title="Disk
      Operating System">DOS</a>, <a href="/windows.html" target="_self"
      rel="dofollow" title="Microsoft Windows">Windows</a> and <a

      <h2 id="16bit">No More BASIC, 16-Bit</h2>
      <p>When 16-bit computers became mainstream in the late 1980s,
      BASIC was no longer part of the OS and programming no longer was
      the main purpose of computers. In most OSs, BASIC was just reduced
      as a stand-alone binary like GW-BASIC (Microsoft, 1983-88) or
      FreeBASIC (2004-present).
