      title="KaiOS Technologies">KaiOS</a>, founded in 2016, is an <a
      href="/android.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow"
      title="Android">Android</a>-based operating system developed by
      American-based company KaiOS Technologies (with offices in Hong
      Kong, Taiwan, China, India, Brazil and France) for smart feature
      phones (not <em>dumb</em> at all). KaiOS was forked from the
      defunct B2G project, which itself was forked from Firefox OS. The
      latter was planned to compete against <a href="/android.html"
      target="_self" rel="dofollow" title="Android">Android</a>
      (especially <a href="/android.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow"
      title="Android">Android Go</a>, not necessarily <a
      href="/ios.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow"
      title="iOS">iOS</a>) on smart phones and other smart devices
      including television sets and even IoT. Unfortunately Firefox OS
      was not well received by developers leading to its demise.</p>
      <p>KaiOS took the Firefox OS (2013-16), which was forked as Boot
      to Gecko (B2G, defunct as of 2017) code and modified it for
      feature phones &mdash; usually with a 1.1 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon
      or similar microprocessor, small internal storage (2.37 GB of 4 GB
      of internal storage used by the built-in apps), 512 MB of RAM, a
      slot for external storage (microSD) up to 32 GB, Bluetooth access,
      no keyboard, no touchscreen (usually the most expensive component
      in most smart phones), flip phone with a 320x240 (portrait only)
      LCD screen (QVGA, 262,144 colors), usually a low resolution (2 MP)
      front camera and no flash.</p>
      <p>Note that Firefox OS, then forked as B2G and now forked as
      KaiOS, boot directly to the Gecko rendering engine (Firefox).
      Therefore apps for KaiOS are coded in HTML5, CCS3 and JS using
      WebIDE (Mozilla Foundation) or their SDK. The latter languages
      allow KaiOS to run on inexpensive yet robust hardware capable of
      running on 2G and 4G at a fraction of the cost thanks to lower
      bandwidth and battery consumption &mdash; about 390 minutes (5
      hours) of talk time and 300 hours (12 days) of stand-by depending
      to the vendor. In reality, my $20 <a
      href="https://amzn.to/2ZAeKII" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
      title="Alcatel A405DL">Alcatel A405DL</a> can get about 6 days on
      stand-by on a full charge, which takes about 2.5 hours if the
      1,350 mAh battery is fully drained.</p>
      <p>Low battery consumption is partially due to fewer background
      online services that would make the system crawl or access
      hardware and/or other software (services, most likely) without
      your consent &mdash; hence more secure. This also means less
      chance of viruses including worms and Trojans. This actually makes
      KaiOS more appropriate for privacy concerns than <a
      href="/android.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow"
      title="Android">Android</a> or <a href="/ios.html" target="_self"
      rel="dofollow" title="iOS">iOS</a>, for that matter.</p>
      <p>Although third-party are apps (usually not part of the OS) are
      browser-based, some of apps can run offline from cache (no feeds
      or hosted apps). The only difference is that KaiOS single image
      advertisement (KaiAds) that runs at the start of these apps fails
      to run (not cached). By the way, the web browser app is simply
      labeled as <tt>Browser</tt> (extremely original name), which can
      hold an offline version of some websites. Strangely enough, as of
      10/22/2019, <a href="https://ucweb.com/" target="_blank"
      rel="nofollow" title="UC Browser">UC Browser</a> (<a
      href="https://ucweb.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="UC
      Browser">UCWeb</a>, part of the Alibaba Group, China) is available
      for KaiOS (a web browser running another web browser).</p>
      <p>There are several companies that are working with and/or have
      invested over $50 million in KaiOS (as of May 2019) including
      Google with an investment of $22 million, which has also supplied
      compatible versions of Google Search, Google Assistant (speech
      recognition rather than using a keypad) and Google Maps. It is
      interesting that Google is helping the competition or trying to
      secure a position in the feature phone market &mdash; a different
      subset of the mobile market.</p>
      <p>KaiOS seems to be more of an ideology than technology. KaiOS is
      pushed as a means to bring poor people to the internet and related
      technologies as well as to give them resources they might need as
      a means of education. This mentality has helped KaiOS become a hit
      in developing countries especially in Asia and Africa bringing
      internet access to over 100 million current (as of May 2019) and
      potential customers who cannot afford or do not want a smart
      phone. Having an app store or repository (KaiStore) offering
      WhatsApp (communication service of choice in many countries in
      Asia and Africa, owned by Facebook) has helped too.</p>
      <p>In India, Jio has invested $7 million and uses KaiOS for their
      mobile phones &mdash; branded as JioPhone (about $25 with a keypad
      only or $45 with a QWERTY keyboard) with its own version of the
      app store (Jio Store). Needless to say, hackers have found a way
      to install and run the KaiStore on any JioPhone.</p>
      <p>In North America, the selection of KaiOS mobile phones is
      extremely limited. Some feature phones running KaiOS, although not
      advertised as such, are targeted to the elderly and start at about
      $20. One of best feature phones (if not the best model) running
      KaiOS in the North American market is the $70 <a
      href="https://amzn.to/2NFjVVu" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
      title="Nokia 8110 4G">Nokia 8110 4G</a> (nicknamed the <em>banana
      phone</em>) with a keypad only &mdash; no keyboard, but with
      Google Assistant.</p>
      <p>KaiOS currently holds a large (if not the largest) piece of the
      feature phone market share and can possibly become the leader in
      this technology in developing countries.</p>
      <p>I could not convince KaiOS to have a vendor send me a free unit
      to test the OS so I had to buy an Alcatel A405DL running KaiOS 2.5
      <!-- ------------------------------------------------------------+

      to test this OS. By the way, to no one's surprise the customer
      support staff had no idea what KaiOS is. Maybe privately-owned
      KaiOS Technologies should advertise their OS in the US as other
      vendors currently do. Maybe this way users can ask for KaiOS when
      buying feature phones instead of simply buying cheap mobile phones
      with some proprietary OS that no one has ever heard of before.
      Hence they could provide KaiOS on more units in the US as an
      alternative to <a href="/ios.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow"

      <p>Note that KaiOS does not save files to microSD and the OS does
      not seem to give any means to change where the path. It seems that
      access to microSD is for users to save and/or move pictures,
      videos, music and other personal files between the internal and
      external storage rather than writing to it.</p>

      <p>I have tested and played with KaiOS since August 2019. My
      Alcatel A405DL runs KaiOS 2.5 (no OS update available), which was
      released in February 2018. Therefore my opinion is based on and
      limited to this version of the OS. Note that KaiOS 2.6 was
      released in May 2019 and vendors started to use the new version of
      the OS as of late 2019 (over a year later). Of course, if Alcatel
      or any other vendor wants me to test a model with KaiOS 2.5.1 or
      higher, I would gladly accept.</p>
      <p>So far, I have noticed is that the version of KaiStore in my
      Alcatel A405DL does not offer the same apps advertised in other
      countries like Google Assistant or other Google apps and/or
      services for the feature phone that I bought. According to KaiOS
      Technologies, the selection of apps and updates depend on the sole
      discretion of the vendor and/or carrier.</p>

        Hello.  Please note that your phone needs to have the
        latest version 2.5.1 for those apps.  Form our side
        this version is pushed, now it is up to Alcatel to
        decide when to push the update for its phones.

            > @KaiHelps Why does #KaiStore in the #USA doesn't
            have the same apps in other countries.  There is no
            #GoogleAssistant.  I have a #KaisOS 2.5 #Alcatel
            #FeaturePhone.  Why is that?
      </pre>
      <p>For my Alcatel A405DL, the selection of apps is fairly poor
      compared to the selection from vendors abroad &mdash; for example,
      JioPhone (India). At the same time, I have checked for updates and
      there is no update for KaiOS 2.5.1 at least for my phone.</p>
      <p>Audio is recorded in either a sample rate of 8 KHz (good enough
      for voice) or 44 KHz (100 Hz short of audio CD quality)
      <tt>.RCD</tt>. The naming convention is prefix <tt>record_</tt>
      followed by the timestamp with format <tt>yyyy-mm-dd_HHmmss</tt>
      (for example, <tt>record_20190904_172958.rcd</tt>).</p>
      <p>The naming convention of the 320x240 (portrait only) pictures
      is fairly annoying where prefix <tt>IMG_</tt> comes before an
      incremental integer from <tt>0001</tt> (<tt>IMG_0001.jpg</tt>) to
      <tt>9999</tt> (<tt>IMG_9999.jpg</tt>) &mdash; in other words, no
      timestamp. At least, screenshots (camera key and volume down) have
      a different naming convention that includes the timestamp with
      format <tt>yyyy-MM-dd-HH-mm-ss</tt> with file type <tt>.PNG</tt>
      (for example, <tt>2019-09-04-17-29-58.png</tt>).</p>
      <p>Videos are recorded in 320x240 (portrait only) <tt>.GPP</tt>
      and saved with the same naming convention as pictures starting
      with prefix <tt>VID_</tt> instead of <tt>IMG_</tt> &mdash; in
      other words, just as annoying.</p>
      <p>Other than my complaint about pictures (not screenshots), I can
      even read my email on <tt>Browser</tt>, but I could not get the
      <tt>E-Mail</tt> app to work with Gmail maybe because of my account
      security.</p>

      <p>One little issue that drives me crazy accessing my email in
      <tt>Browser</tt> is having to authenticate much too often. I
      understand having to log in to 802.11 every time I move from one
      network to another (home to work and vice versa), but it seems
      that cookies in the built-in web browser (<tt>Browser</tt>) have a
      much more limited life than most browsers.</p>
      <p>From what I can see so far, the mobile phone that I bought with
      KaiOS 2.5 (Alcatel A405DL) has the proper coder-decoders
      (<em>codecs</em>) for audio (<tt>.MP3</tt> &amp; <tt>.OOG</tt>),
      video (<tt>.MP4</tt>, <tt>.GPP</tt>, <tt>.OGV</tt> &amp;
      <tt>.GPP</tt>), images including wallpapers (<tt>.JPEG</tt>,
      <tt>.JPG</tt> &amp; <tt>.BMP</tt>) and texts (<tt>.TXT</tt>).</p>
      <p>Since apps for KaiOS do not require lots of resources, I was
      surprised when the <tt>Magnify</tt> app (a virtual magnifying
      glass) developed by Kai performs better and does not shake as much
      as similar apps in <a href="/android.html" target="_self"
      rel="dofollow" title="Android">Android</a>.</p>
      <p>Maybe I am too much of a nerd, but I really like my $20 feature
      phone regardless of its limitations like having to type using a
      keypad (13 keystrokes just to say <em>&quot;hello&quot;</em>). By
      the way, if you are wondering why I get so excited about this
      <em>archaic</em> phone, I like most old technologies (hence the
      name of <a href="/" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title="VintageOS
      v5D8BBEDD">VintageOS</a>). KaiOS has a <em>retro</em> look and
      feel that I like. Besides, there are many dumb phones in the
      market that offer less than KaiOS and some are much more expensive
      than a $20 Alcatel A405DL (no advertisement, no endorsement).</p>

          Good news came from a business website that mentioned that
          Google might have invested $22 million in order to secure the
          Indian market with the JioPhone. Then again, Google might be
          interested in having a foot in the feature phone market and/or
          as a means to keep Amazon's Alexa out of the picture (no
          competition from Microsoft's Cortana). By the way, the light
          version of <a href="/android.html" target="_self"
          rel="dofollow" title="Android">Android</a> (<a
          href="/android.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow"
          title="Android">Android Go</a>) is not making an impact in the
          American market. The price of <a href="/android.html"
          target="_self" rel="dofollow" title="Android">Android Go</a>
          phones is almost the same as a full <a href="/android.html"
          target="_self" rel="dofollow" title="Android">Android</a>
          phone (over <a href="https://amzn.to/2owokQ2" target="_blank"
          rel="nofollow" title="Android phones">$100</a>) compared to
          the $20 that I paid for my Alcatel A405DL. This article makes
          more sense and I like that I had assumed the same when I first
          heard of the investment. In other words, KaiOS has
          surprisingly better sales than the light version of the
          almighty <a href="/android.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow"

          Another rumor was promising although goes against the product
          that KaiOS wants to provide. Some think that Jio (India) wants
          to add touchscreens to their JioPhone 3 running KaiOS.

      <p>I hope the first two rumors are fake. If KaiOS wants to
      continue making an impact, it should remain independent and not
      allow takeovers by any company &mdash; especially Google and/or
      Microsoft.</p>
      <section role="section">
        <h2 id="Installation">Installing KaiOS:</h2>
        <p>As with most mobile devices (especially phones), there is no
        installation. There is no way for users to flash the ROM unless
        rooting it. As with other mobile devices, updates are pushed via
        firmware flashing by the manufacturer itself.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, hackers have made ways to exploit the hardware
        in a different way and even replacement operating systems for
        the hardware &mdash; for example, <a href="https://gerda.tech/"
        target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="GerdaOS">GerdaOS</a> to
        &quot;a custom ROM to liberate the heart of Kai&quot; as per the
