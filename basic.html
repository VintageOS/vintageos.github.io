      <h1 id="main">What is BASIC?</h1>
      <h2 id="subtitle">(although not an OS in the modern sense, but a
      complete instruction set nonetheless)</h2>
      <p>BASIC (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) was
      more than an entry-level programming language. It was part of the
      instruction set (not quite an OS) for early home computers like
      the TRS-80 Model III running on TRS-DOS or NEWDOS and Commodore 64
      (C64) running on the ROM-resident OS named KERNAL (misspelling of
      <em>kernel</em>).</p>
      <p>I remember reading lots of books on BASIC and Byte Magazine and
      watching Bits and Bytes on channel 13 (1983-1984). My experience
      at school was on a TRS-80 Model III, on which I coded several
      programs that no longer exist (saved on cassette tape, which was
      an unreliable medium). At home, I spent many hours in front of my
      C64. This is why, on this page, I can only concentrate on my
      experience of BASIC on C64.</p>
    </article>
    <article role="article">
      <h2 id="C64">Commodore 64:</h2>
      <p>C64 was
      one of the first computer systems that I ever used and the first
      one I ever owned (1984). I quickly got up hooked into a whole new
      field and style of life &mdash; <em>geekdom</em> &mdash; while
      coding source code instead of sleeping. KERNAL and Commodore BASIC
      in its 8-bit glory for C64 boasting a 1.023 MHz microprocessor and
      64 KB of RAM gave and experience was as close at it could be for
      any kid n the early 1980's (1984, in my case). To make things even
      more exciting and bringing more curious kids (like me at the time)
      to computer science, C64 was heavily used for games and even some
      music programs thanks to its ground-breaking technology based on
      two chips by MOS Technology &mdash; SIC 6581 and VIC-II. Commodore
      International declared bankruptcy and closed shop in 1994. In
      2011, a new reincarnation named Commodore USA released updated
      versions of C64 (C64x) with the same vintage (old, obsolete,
      ancient, historical, <em>retro</em>) &quot;breadbox&quot; exterior
      and VIC 20 (VIC Slim) with their own Linux distribution named
      Commodore OS. I had not been thrilled about any new system and/or
      other technologies for a long time. The whole idea of reviving the
      C64x had me like a little kid before Christmas with a new toy
      wrapped in front of him, but I never bought one. Commodore USA
      closed shop a little after one of its owners died around 2012.</p>
      <p align="center"><a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Commodore-64-Computer.png"
      target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img
      src="/img/320px-Commodore-64-Computer.png" height="158"
      width="320" border="0" class="boxes" alt="Commodore 64 Computer"
      title="Commodore 64 Computer"></a></p>
      <p>For those of us who want to relive the heyday of C64 (1982-85),
      a new version of C64 was released in 2018 called <em>The C64
      Mini</em> marketed as a video game console with 64 built-in games
      and shipped with its own joystick. According to the vendor,
      <em>The C64 Mini</em> can also be used to program Commodore BASIC
      (forked from Microsoft BASIC) &mdash; the first programming
      language that I ever learned. Needless to say, I am stoked.</p>
      <pre>
        10 INPUT "WHAT'S YOUR NAME?"; NAME$
        20 PRINT "HELLO, "; NAME$;
        30 INPUT ", HOW ARE YOU? (OK/NOT)"; OK$
        40 IF OK$ = "OK" THEN PRINT "GLAD TO HEAR THAT."
        50 IF OK$ &lt;&gt; "OK" THEN PRINT "TOO BAD!"
      </pre>
      <p>Another nostalgia option is Manomio's licensed emulator for iOS
      &mdash; iPhone, iPod and iPad. This emulator is almost as good as
      the original.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately it has been almost thirty (30) years since I last
      coded my last program for the C64 and I hardly remember how to
      code a quick and dirty (not to mention descent) program (excluding
      the one above), but I would consider it the geekiest purchase I
      have would ever make. Of course, if you are merely interested in
      C64 games, you can get a ROM emulator and a handful of ROM images,
      which may be illegal in some areas and/or under special conditions

      <h2 id="Versions">Other Versions of BASIC:</h2>
      <p>There are many versions (dialects) of BASIC. The following is a
      quick list of interpreters in chronological order.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Microsoft BASIC originally released as Altair BASIC for Altair
          8800 (1975)
        </li>
        <li>
          Integer BASIC, also known as Apple BASIC, for Apple I and
          Apple II (1977)
        </li>
        <li>
          Commodore BASIC for PET (1977) to C128 (1985)
        </li>
        <li>
          Color BASIC for TRS-80 CoCo (1980-1991)
        </li>
        <li>
          BASIC Programming ROM cartridge (Warren Robinett, 1979),
          replaced with Atari Microsoft BASIC for Atari 8-bit home
          computers sold on floppy and ROM cartridge under the name
          Atari Microsoft BASIC II (Microsoft, 1981-1992) IBM BASIC
          available as Cassette BASIC, Disk BASIC and Advanced BASIC
          (BASICA) for IBM 5150 (1981) and Cartridge BASIC for IBM PCjr
          (1984)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </article>
    <article role="article">
      <h2 id="Installation">Installing BASIC:</h2>
      <p>BASIC on i286 and prior machines came burnt to a ROM chip.
      There is no way users could install BASIC. On boot, it loads from
      the built-in ROM to RAM. Later machines would run <a
      href="/dos.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title="Disk
      Operating System">DOS</a> and have BASIC as a stand-alone
      executable like <tt class="console">QBASIC.EXE</tt> (Microsoft
      BASIC), but by no means an OS or similar instruction set.</p>
