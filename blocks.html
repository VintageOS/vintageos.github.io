      I have always liked construction blocks. They work in a certain
      order and fail if the order is not followed. I have equated
      computer science with construction blocks since I started playing
      with computers. I am curious about the different instruction sets
      and how to employ each author uses those instruction sets.</p>
      <p>At the same time, block programming uses a similar concept to
      that of construction blocks. Each block contains a package of
      code and the programmer does not need to know what the code is or
      does. For example, MIT developed <a href=
      "https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=
      "Scratch">Scratch</a> for children, in which a child can write a
      program as if it were a flowchart. For example, a block that
      might be labeled <tt>WALK</tt> might have code to make an image
      (sprite) walk. Another might be labeled <tt>STAND</tt>, which
      might make an image stand up. With these two blocks, the child
      can either make the image walk and stand up (most likely the
      wrong logic) or stand up and walk (more appropriate logic)
      depending on the order of the blocks (functions, procedures and
      other recyclable code), which is the principle of object
      programming. At the same time, this is the principle behind
      building blocks where the position of the construction blocks
      determine the look and/or function of the end result.</p>
      <p>The following is simply my opinion of some brands that I have
      bought sets from (<a href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target=
      "_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Lego">Lego</a>, <a href=
      "https://amzn.to/2SWW5cF" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=

      others that I find interesting like <a href=

      Made in Billund, Denmark, since 1932, <a href=
      "https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=
      "Lego">Lego</a> is the most common brand name when it comes to
      interlocking construction blocks. Several companies worldwide
      have cloned <a href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank"
      rel="nofollow" title="Lego">Lego</a> blocks for years in an
      attempt to grab part of the market. As such, <a href=
      "https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=
      "Lego">Lego</a> has become the benchmark, on which similar
      building systems are based on.</p>
      <p>The quality of <a href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target=
      "_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Lego">Lego</a> has changed various
      times. In the late 1980s, the quality diminished and its blocks
      did not look as polished. This is about the same time that
      <a href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
      title="Lego">Lego</a> had lost a good share of its market. In the
      early 1990s, the quality returned to its former self — well
      polished blocks without injection molding defects, spots left
      behind where blocks were attached to others or the injector
      itself. Note that all <a href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target=
      "_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Lego">Lego</a> pieces including
      parts of their minifigures have the <a href=
      "https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=
      "Lego">Lego</a> name on each stud or inside flat pieces.</p>
      <p><a href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank" rel=
      "nofollow" title="Lego">Lego</a> models have always come exposed
      studs. Compared to <a href="https://amzn.to/2SWW5cF" target=
      "_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Cobi">Cobi</a>, <a href=
      "https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=
      "Lego">Lego</a> models look unfinished. Then again, <a href=
      "https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=
      "Lego">Lego</a> is the industry standard although <a href=
      "https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=
      "Lego">Lego</a> itself is a clone of an older interlock block
      system — Kiddicraft, which was first released by British company
      Hilary Page in 1944.</p>
      <p><a href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank" rel=
      "nofollow" title="Lego">Lego</a> minifigures (not Duplo or
      Fabuland figures) were first released in 1976 (no movable parts
      and no face). The minifigures that most people know about (with
      arms, legs, hands and faces) were first released in 1978. These
      minifigures are the most common recognized from other brands.
      Unfortunately <a href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank"
      rel="nofollow" title="Lego">Lego</a> minifigures are highly
      cloned although it is illegal as <a href=
      "https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=
      "Lego">Lego</a> holds the pattern and rights worldwide. There are
      lots of fake <a href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank"
      rel="nofollow" title="Lego">Lego</a> models mostly coming from
      China with <a href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank" rel=
      "nofollow" title="Lego">Lego</a>-like minifigures — for example,
      Lepin. At the same time, some Chinese vendors even use fake
      brands — for example, <a href="https://amzn.to/3LWKErc" target=
      "_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Sembo">Sembo</a> that uses M&amp;H
      instead of H&amp;M to make people believe that the model is
      licensed by the clothing store.</p>
      <p>The only issue that I find with <a href=
      "https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=
      "Lego">Lego</a> minifigures is that they do not have human
      proportion. These figures look chunky. Of course, it does not
      help that <a href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank" rel=
      "nofollow" title="Lego">Lego</a> used the four-stud width for all
      cars for almost four decades, which were proper for the 1976
      two-stud wide minifigures with no arms or legs. Nowadays
      (finally) <a href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank" rel=
      "nofollow" title="Lego">Lego</a> makes cars wider and more
      proportionally correct using an even number of studs — usually
      six or eight studs wide. There are also some cars that are nine
      studs wide, which seems to have been adopted from <a href=
      "https://amzn.to/2SWW5cF" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=
      "Cobi">Cobi</a> models like the Youngtimer Collection and the
      Maserati licensed models. What is interesting in the new design
      of race cars is that it looks too much like <a href=
      "https://amzn.to/3tPB5RC" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=
      "Sluban (小鲁班)">Sluban</a> (<a href="https://amzn.to/3tPB5RC"
      target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Sluban (小鲁班)">小鲁班</a>) or
      perhaps it is the way around.</p>

      its models. <a href="https://amzn.to/33QtnMq" target="_blank"
      rel="nofollow" title="Oxford (옥스포드)">Oxford</a> is the perfect
      clone. It is my understanding that <a href=
      "https://amzn.to/33QtnMq" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=
      "Oxford (옥스포드)">Oxford</a> is licensed to produce its bricks and
      minifigures identical to those of <a href=
      "https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=
      "Lego">Lego</a>. The biggest difference is that <a href=
      "https://amzn.to/33QtnMq" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=
      "Oxford (옥스포드)">Oxford</a> does not put its brand name on its
      pieces.</p>
      <p>There are three model of <a href="https://amzn.to/33QtnMq"
      target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Oxford (옥스포드)">Oxford</a>
      minifigures. One model looks exactly to <a href=
      "https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=
      "Lego">Lego</a> minifigures. Another model has slightly round
      legs and feet. The third model is my favorite with articulated
      knees.</p>
      <p>What makes <a href="https://amzn.to/33QtnMq" target="_blank"
      rel="nofollow" title="Oxford (옥스포드)">Oxford</a> highly
      interesting is the licensing from the Republic of Korea (ROK)
      National Military, Dunkin Donuts, Kellogg's Cafe and several
      others. In the US, <a href="https://amzn.to/33QtnMq" target=
      "_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Oxford (옥스포드)">Oxford</a> made the
      Kre-O brand name for Hasbro — in other words, <a href=
      "https://amzn.to/33QtnMq" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=
      "Oxford (옥스포드)">Oxford</a> repackaged as Kre-O (2011-17). Since
      Hasbro pulled the plug on the Kre-O line, <a href=
      "https://amzn.to/33QtnMq" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=
      "Oxford (옥스포드)">Oxford</a> as a whole lost its market share in
      the US.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately buying <a href="https://amzn.to/33QtnMq" target=
      "_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Oxford (옥스포드)">Oxford</a> models
      in the US is hard and fairly expensive — about two or three times
      as much as a similar <a href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target=

      The latter is why I have no experience with <a href=

      title="Mega">Mega</a> was a company based in Montreal, Quebec,
      Canada, where they made from 1985 till Mattel took over in 2014.
      Mattel moved production to China and Mexico. <a href=
      "https://amzn.to/3buqbuc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=

      and specialized <a href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank"
      rel="nofollow" title="Lego">Lego</a>-compatible sets with
      different themes like the Power Rangers, Teenage Mutant Ninja

      under the brand name of <a href="https://amzn.to/3buqbuc" target=

      "https://amzn.to/3buqbuc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=

      <p><a href="https://amzn.to/3buqbuc" target="_blank" rel=
      "nofollow" title="Mega">Mega</a> does not have standard
      minifigures anymore. The older model of their minifigures were
      too close to <a href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank"
      rel="nofollow" title="Lego">Lego</a> minifigures making a good
      product look like a cheap knockoff. These older minifigures are
      no longer produced to avoid lawsuits (as what happened to Lepin
      when Lego sued them for intellectual theft) as well as bad
      reputation. The new minifigures are rather made according to the
      theme and license. In other words, their minifigures are small
      versions of the characters that they represent. He-Man and the
      Masters of the Universe looks like the actual character from the
      television series with articulated arms and legs.</p>

      "https://amzn.to/2SWW5cF" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=
      "Cobi">Cobi</a> holds a good part of a market share that <a href=
      "https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=
      "Lego">Lego</a> does not want to be involved — military models
      and various weapons, which are highly accurate and come with
      historical facts. The latter means that <a href=
      "https://amzn.to/2SWW5cF" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=
      "Cobi">Cobi</a> models are accurate design making its models are
      for collectors rather than not only fun to build, but they are
      educational too and fairly for playing. From what I have been
      able to observe, <a href="https://amzn.to/2SWW5cF" target=
      "_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Cobi">Cobi</a> has a hold
      primarily of the adult (16+) market with its historical models,
      some of which can consist of over 1,000 pieces.</p>
      <p>Their biggest sellers are the Historical Collection (WWW and
      WWW), Youngtimer Collection (European cars including those from
      the Soviet Bloc) and other licensed models like Maserati, Fiat,
      Doctor Who (under the old Character Toys brand, 2012) and even
      the UK military.</p>
      <p>The quality is excellent although the bricks are a bit too
      bright compared to <a href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target=

      "https://amzn.to/2SWW5cF" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=

      "_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Cobi">Cobi</a> also has its own
      block designs, which helps <a href="https://amzn.to/2SWW5cF"
      target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Cobi">Cobi</a> produce more
      realistic models. Just other vendors, the <a href=

      <p>One major difference between <a href="https://amzn.to/2SWW5cF"
      target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Cobi">Cobi</a> and <a href=
      "https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=
      "Lego">Lego</a> is that <a href="https://amzn.to/2SWW5cF" target=
      "_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Cobi">Cobi</a> models usually use
      flat pieces for its exterior. In my opinion, this makes its
      models cleaner and more professional — an opinion that I had
      since getting my second <a href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target=
      "_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Lego">Lego</a> in 1980 (#6627).
      Ironically <a href="https://amzn.to/2SWW5cF" target="_blank" rel=
      "nofollow" title="Cobi">Cobi</a> models are more expensive than
      those by <a href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank" rel=

      In 2006, <a href="https://amzn.to/2SWW5cF" target="_blank" rel=

      "Lego">Lego</a> minifigures made in China although based in

      "https://amzn.to/2SWW5cF" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=
      "Cobi">Cobi</a> manufacturing process. Strangely enough, the
      Best-Lock website still advertises OEM (original equipment
      manufacturer) pieces and how its products are sold by other
      parties under different names. The latter is fairly confusing
      especially with Darren Toys still selling Best-Lock models.</p>
      <p>Just other vendors, older <a href="https://amzn.to/2SWW5cF"
      target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Cobi">Cobi</a> figures as
      well as Best-Lock minifigures looked like bad <a href=

      "https://amzn.to/2SWW5cF" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=
      "Cobi">Cobi</a> minifigures look more human with better
      proportion, molded facial expressions, mouths and even noses.
      <a href="https://amzn.to/2SWW5cF" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
      title="Cobi">Cobi</a> uses different models for the figure heads
      to display various expressions and even bandages in soldiers.
      These minifigures have become my favorites in the past couple of

      (adults) alike.</p>

      although bragging of being <em>"developmental constructors of
      European quality"</em> (Feb. 2020) located in Moscow, Russian
      Federation. As per the EAC (Евразийское соответствие, Eurasian
      Conformity) marking on every box, one would get the impression
      that these bricks were made Russia (Россия), Belarus (Беларусь),
      Armenia (Армения), Kazakhstan (Казахстан) or Kyrgyzstan
      (Кыргызстан). The reality is that these blocks are made in China
      (possibly by <a href="https://amzn.to/3wdQA8d" target="_blank"

      "https://amzn.to/3wdQA8d" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=

      although they all seem to have the same quality of plastic
      (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, simply referred to as ABS with
      formula <tt>(C8H8·C4H6·C3H3N)n</tt> where <tt>n</tt> is a
      variable depending on quality and production cost) most likely
      coming from the same factory as <a href="https://amzn.to/3wdQA8d"
      target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Qman (启蒙)">Qman</a> or
      similar vendor.</p>
      <p><a href="https://amzn.to/3eYWfZu" target="_blank" rel=
      "nofollow" title="Gorod Masterov (Город Мастеров)">Gorod
      Masterov</a> mostly covers Russian cars and trucks like GAZelle
      (ГАЗе́ль) by GAZ (ГАЗ), Zhiguli (Жигули) an Lada (Лада) by
      AvtoVAZ (АвтоВАЗ), KAMAZ (КАМАЗ) and Ural (Урал) as well as the
      Russian military. By the way, one of my earliest memories (c.
      1974) was riding in my uncle's Lada, which he used as a taxi.</p>
      <p>One thing that I do not like is that minifigures cannot fit in
      some of these models. Some cars and trucks come with one-piece
      hollow truck cabins and full outer shell of some cars. It just
      takes the fun away. Those one-piece cabins come without seats or
      doors and grayed out windshields (not clear plastic). I find this
      fairly deceiving because the boxes show clear windshields and
      even minifigures inside as if the truck cabins were usable. Maybe
      models of KAMAZ or Ural trucks might need this sort one-piece
      cabins to show what these cabins look like in real KAMAZ or Ural
      trucks (same mold for all models per brand, not up to scale with
      the minifigures, fairly unimpressive approach). These models are
      four studs wide just like <a href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR"
      target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Lego">Lego</a> used to do
      up to 1978 — realistic look, but impractical since the driver
      (minifigure) is too big for these models. <a href=
      "https://amzn.to/3eYWfZu" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=
      "Gorod Masterov (Город Мастеров)">Gorod Masterov</a> should make
      the truck cabins in such way that minifigures could fit inside or
      simply larger — considering the size of the minifigure, at least
      six studs wide. The need for realistic look and feel might also
      be for the outer shell of cars, but at least minifigures can be
      put inside these cars.</p>
      <p>I cannot find these models anywhere, not even in <a href=
      "https://amzn.to/33UnfDb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=
      "Amazon">Amazon</a>. The only thing I can speculate is that the
      brand name is adopted from the 1966 Russian movie <a href=
      "https://amzn.to/3eYWfZu" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=
      "Gorod Masterov (Город Мастеров)">Город Мастеров</a>, which is a
      children's story that I have not yet watched. As a matter of
      fact, I have not been able to find the movie with English
      subtitles anywhere.</p>
      <p>Just like <a href="https://amzn.to/3eYWfZu" target="_blank"
      rel="nofollow" title="Gorod Masterov (Город Мастеров)">Gorod
      Masterov</a>, many companies producing <a href=
      "https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=
      "Lego">Lego</a> clones use non-branded Chinese-made blocks. There
      are also companies that specialize in minifigures that may cost
      anywhere from 75¢ to $10 — mostly counterfeit <a href=
      "https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=
      "Lego">Lego</a> minifigures. Therefore any company can sell
      designs without worrying about production cost other than
      packaging including artwork on boxes and instruction sets.</p>

      Sluban minifigures from 2004 to approximately 2014 looked like
      cheap <a href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR" target="_blank" rel=

      minifigures are different from most other vendors (green truck,

      giving the brand an independent presence and credibility in the

      <p>Most if not all <a href="https://amzn.to/3tPB5RC" target=
      "_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Sluban (小鲁班)">Sluban</a> models
      are fairly cartoonish like <a href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR"
      target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Lego">Lego</a> and other
      vendors except for the Model Bricks line of high-end cars, tanks
      and airplanes that could rival the design quality (not accuracy,
      not properly scaled) of both <a href="https://amzn.to/3htO7BR"
      target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Lego">Lego</a> (not daring

      "Cobi">Cobi</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/3tPB5RC" target=
      "_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Sluban (小鲁班)">Sluban</a> has a
      large selection of military models although scale and details are
      not necessarily accurate. Most <a href="https://amzn.to/3tPB5RC"
      target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Sluban (小鲁班)">Sluban</a>
      models come with flat pieces for their exterior for a cleaner
      look — yet not as polished like <a href="https://amzn.to/2SWW5cF"
      target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Cobi">Cobi</a>.</p>
      <p>What I find strange is that <a href="https://amzn.to/3tPB5RC"
      target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Sluban (小鲁班)">Sluban</a>
      has models in China that are not available worldwide. I strongly
      believe that some of these models could sell well in the United
      States, at least, due to the fascination of the Asian culture in
      this country.</p>
      <p>As a little piece of trivia, the little boy in the <a href=
      "https://amzn.to/3tPB5RC" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=

      "https://amzn.to/3tPB5RC" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=
      "Sluban (小鲁班)">Sluban</a>. From an advertisement and marketing
      point of view, naming the mascot (a bald boy in overalls who
      plays with <a href="https://amzn.to/3tPB5RC" target="_blank" rel=
      "nofollow" title="Sluban (小鲁班)">Sluban</a> models) after the
      brand name is a smart move. Children might identify with <a href=
      "https://amzn.to/3tPB5RC" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=
      "Sluban (小鲁班)">Sluban</a> (the character) faster than linking the

          simply adorable. Prices range from ₽149 ($2.33) to ₽999
          ($15.61). My favorite model is the ₽499 ($7.80) truck — dirt

          <p>The only reason I am bringing the Minifigured name is
          because they sell minifigures, on which any person or company
          can have anything printed on them. This is much better that
          some random business card. I have considered having them
          print the logo and name of <a href="/" target="_self" rel=

          v20211218223349</a> as means of advertisement. These
          minifigures are also good as a momentum of an event — for
          example, a child's birthday as party favors.</p>
          <p>Minifigured uses minifigures that look identical to those
          from <a href="https://amzn.to/3tPB5RC" target="_blank" rel=

          vendor.</p>
          <p>Note that the minifigure in this section is for Team
          Keller, Great Strides, which helps individuals with cystic
          fibrosis and/or supports the research of cystic fibrosis. In
          no way, <a href="/" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=

          related to Team Keller or Great Strides. The purpose of
          including the minifigure is to show how a company can use
          building blocks to promote any for-profit or non-profit third
          party.</p>
