          originally stood for <em>Control Program/Monitor</em> and then
          it changed to <em>Control Program for Microcomputers</em>. The
          first release was in 1974 by Digital Research &mdash; two
          years after <a href="/unix.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow"
          title="Unix">Unix</a> was released in its native C. The latest
          release was 3.1 in 1983. The CP/M market was taken over by <a
          href="/dos.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title="Disk
          Operating System">DOS</a> in the late 1980s. Although there
          has not been much developement or any at all on the OS, CP/M
          is not considered obsolete thanks to many enthusiasts and its
          <a href="/bsd.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow"
          title="Berkeley Software Distribution">BSD</a>-like license.
          Since most machines in the market nowadays are x86, you should
          look into CP/M-86 3.1 if you would like to try this OS. Note
          that 86 refers to x86 chipsets, not the year, and 3.1 is the
          version of the OS. By the way, my only memory of CP/M was
          using WordStar to type some biology papers in high school.</p>

          target="_self" rel="dofollow" title="Other Operating Systems
          &raquo; Images">image</a> (<tt>.IMG</tt>) fits in a 1.44 MB
          floppy, that can be burned to floppy or mounted as a virtual
          drive. The full image available in an <tt>.ISO</tt> is under
          70 MB and it also needs at least 8 MB of RAM to load the OS.
          In either case, the whole OS (not only the kernel) is loaded
          to memory and not from disk to memory (no swapping). There is
          no installation and any change you make can be written back to
          the image &mdash; not to root (<tt>/</tt>), but rather to one
          of the subdirectories in the image. One idea is
          <tt>/fd/1/SETTINGS/RAMDRIVE.BAK</tt> to keep all OS settings
          together and hence organized. The software bundled in the
          image is interesting to say the least. Its web browser WebView
          2.65b is similar to Lynx, but with a modern GUI. KolibriOS
          also has its own Bash-like shell although limited to 28
          external commands (excluding kernel commands). The image comes
          with several games, several emulators for several video game
          platforms like SNES and even <a href="/dos.html#DOSBox"

          The OS will a menu listing a set of files including some
          programs you can run as with any OS. Note that some of these
          files are not accessible as in the case of <tt>KERNEL.BIN</tt>
          since it is a system file. What I do not understand is why the
          file is not hidden in the first place. Part of the idea behind
          MikeOS is teaching how simple a 16-bit OS works with lots of
          documentation to study and learn from. The MikeOS website has
          a collection of applications for download including a package

          <p>Symbian was a mobile phone and real-time operating system
          (RTOS) from 1998 to 2013. This OS started as EPOC developed by
          Psion for their personal digital organizer (PDA). Most Symbian
          applications were written using the Qt framework, C, C++,
          Python, Java, Flash Lite, Ruby, .NET, web runtime (based on
          ActiveX) and WebKit for the built-in Opera web browser. In my
          opinion, the programming languages used in this OS make it too

          who was sure that God had asked him to write this OS in a
          special version of C, which Davis named Holy-C, and assembler.
          Using the OS is difficult unless you understand its syntax

          &mdash; not assembler as most OSs in this list &mdash; by
          Jo&atilde;o Costa (a.k.a. <em>YuukiDesu9</em> or simply
          <em>Yuuki</em>) that runs from its <a href="/#Images"

          installation. Since Costa is the lead and practically sole
          programmer, the development of this hobby OS is a tad slow.

          at the top prompting users to type the commands at the bottom
          of the screen without any means to recall the previous
          commands like <tt>DOSKEY.EXE</tt>.</p>
