      title="KaiOS">KaiOS</a>, founded in 2016, is an <a
      href="/android.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow"
      title="Android">Android</a>-based operating system developed by
      American company KaiOS Technologies (offices in Hong Kong, Taiwan,
      China, India, Brazil and France) for feature phones (not smart
      phones, but rather semi-smart <em>dumb</em> phones) forked from
      the defunct Firefox OS (2013-16). Firefox OS was planned to
      compete against <a href="/android.html" target="_self"
      rel="dofollow" title="Android">Android</a> (not necessarily <a
      href="/ios.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow"
      title="iOS">iOS</a>) on smart phones and other smart devices
      including television sets. Unfortunately Firefox OS was not well
      received by developers leading to its demise.</p>
      <p>KaiOS took the Firefox OS (forked as Boot to Gecko OS or
      B2G OS, defunct as of 2017) code and modified it for feature
      phones &mdash; usually with a 1.1 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon
      microprocessor, small internal storage (2.37 GB of about 4 GB used
      by the built-in apps), 512 MB of RAM, a slot for external storage
      (microSD) up to 32 GB, Bluetooth access, no keyboard, no
      touchscreen (usually the most expensive component in a smart
      phone), clamshell (flip phone) with a 320x240 LCD screen (QVGA,
      262,144 colors) and usually a low quality (2 MP) camera.</p>
      <p>Note that Firefox OS and now KaiOS boot directly to Gecko
      (Firefox). Therefore apps for KaiOS are coded in HTML5, CCS3 and
      JavaScript using Mozilla's WebIDE. This allows them to run on
      inexpensive hardware (that would not break easily and hence fairly
      affordable) capable of running on 2G and 4G at a fraction of the
      cost thanks to lower bandwidth and battery consumption (about 390
      minutes of talk time and 300 hours of stand-by).</p>
      <p>Although third-party are apps (usually not part of the OS) are
      browser-based, some of apps can run offline (no feeds or hosted
      apps). The only difference is that theKaiOS single image
      advertisement (KaiAds) that runs at the start of these apps fails
      to run (not cached). By the way, the web browser app is simply
      labeled as <tt>Browser</tt> (extremely original).</p>
      <p>There are several companies that are working with and/or have
      invested over $50 million in KaiOS (as of May 2019) including
      Google with an investment of $22 million, which has also supplied
      compatible versions of Google Search, Google Assistant (speech
      recognition rather than using a keypad) and Google Maps. It is
      interesting that Google is helping the competition or trying to
      secure a position in the feature phone market &mdash; a different
      subset of the mobile market.</p>
      <p>KaiOS has become a hit in
      developing countries especially in Asia and Africa bringing
      internet access to over 100 million current (as of May 2019) and
      potential customers who cannot afford a smart phone. Having an
      app store or repository (KaiStore) offering Facebook's WhatsApp
      (communication service of choice in most of Asia and Africa) has
      helped too.</p>
      <p>In India, Jio has invested $7 million and uses KaiOS for their
      mobile phones &mdash; branded as JioPhone (about $25 with a
      keypad only or $45 with a QWERTY keyboard) with its own version of
      the app store (Jio Store). Needless to say, hackers have found a
      way to install and run the KaiStore on any JioPhone.</p>
      <p>In North America, the selection of KaiOS mobile phones is
      extremely limited. Some feature phones running KaiOS, although not
      advertised as such, are targeted to the elderly and start at about
      <a href="https://amzn.to/2ZAeKII" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
      title="Alcatel A405DL">$20</a> (<a href="https://amzn.to/2ZAeKII"
			target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Alcatel A405DL">$10</a> if
			refurbished as of September 2020). The best feature phones running
      KaiOS in the North American market is the Nokia 8110 4G (nicknamed
      <em>the banana phone</em>) with a retail price of <a
      href="https://amzn.to/2NFjVVu" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
      title="Nokia 8110 4G">$70</a> with a keypad only.</p>
      <p>KaiOS currently holds a large (if not the largest) piece of the
      feature phone market share and can possibly become the leader in
      this technology in developing countries.</p>
      <p>I could not convince KaiOS to give a free unit from any vendor
      to test the OS so I had to buy an <a
      href="https://amzn.to/2ZAeKII" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
      title="Alcatel A405DL">Alcatel A405DL</a> running KaiOS 2.5 for <a
      href="https://amzn.to/2ZAeKII" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
      title="Alcatel A405DL">$20</a> (no service, 802.11 only) <!-- ++++

      +  https://tracfoneusermanual.net/alcatel-myflip-user-manual/  -->
      to test this OS. By the way, to no one's surprise the customer
      support staff had no idea what KaiOS is. Maybe KaiOS Technologies
      should advertise their OS in the US. Maybe this way users can ask
      for KaiOS when buying feature phones instead of simply buying
      cheap mobile phones with some proprietary OS that no one has ever
      heard of before. Hence they could provide KaiOS on more units in
      the US as an alternative to <a href="/ios.html" target="_self"

      <p>Note that KaiOS does not save files to microSD and the OS does
      not seem to give any means to change where the path. It seems that
      access to microSD is for users to save and/or move pictures,
      videos, music and other personal files between the internal and
      external storage rather than writing to it.</p>

      <p>I am excited to test KaiOS 2.5 although it was released in
      February 2018. As of August 2019 (when I tested it), the latest
      version was KaiOS 2.6, which was released in May 2019.</p>
      <p>One thing that I have noticed so far is that the version of
      KaiStore does not offer the same apps advertised in other
      countries like Google Assistant or other Google apps or services
      for the feature phone that I bought. According to KaiOS the
      selection of apps depends on the sole decision and selection of
      the vendor and/or carrier &mdash; in my case, <a
      href="https://amzn.to/2ZAeKII" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
      title="Alcatel A405DL">Alcatel A405DL</a>. This selection is
      fairly poor compared to the selection from vendors abroad, for
      example, JioPhone (India).</p>
      <p>Audio is recorded in either at 8 KHz or 44 KHz (CD quality)
      sample rate <tt>.RCD</tt>. The naming convention is basically the
      timestamp with format <tt>yyyy-mm-dd_HHmmss</tt> (for example,
      <tt>record_20190904_172958.rcd</tt>).</p>
      <p>The naming convention of the 320x240 pictures (only portrait,
      not landscape) is fairly annoying where the prefix <tt>IMG_</tt>
      comes before an incremental integer from <tt>0001</tt>
      (<tt>IMG_0001.jpg</tt>) to <tt>9999</tt> (<tt>IMG_9999.jpg</tt>)
      &mdash; in other words, no timestamp. At least, screenshots
      (camera key and volume down) have a different naming convention
      that includes the timestamp with format
      <tt>yyyy-MM-dd-HH-mm-ss</tt> (for example,
      <tt>2019-09-04-17-29-58.png</tt>).</p>
      <p>Videos are recorded in 320x240 <tt>.GPP</tt> and saved with the
      same naming convention as pictures starting with the suffix
      <tt>VID_</tt> instead of <tt>IMG_</tt> &mdash; in other words,
      just as annoying.</p>
      <p>Other than my complaint about pictures (not screenshots), I can
      even read my email on <tt>Browser</tt>. I could not get the
      <tt>E-Mail</tt> app to work  with Gmail maybe because of the
      account security.</p>

      <p>One little issue that drives me crazy accessing my email in
      <tt>Browser</tt> is to authenticating much too often. I understand
      having to log in to 802.11 every time I move from one network to
      another (home to work and vice versa).</p>
      <p>From what I can see so far, the mobile phone that I bought
      (<a href="https://amzn.to/2ZAeKII" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
      title="Alcatel A405DL">Alcatel A405DL</a> for <a
      href="https://amzn.to/2ZAeKII" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
      title="Alcatel A405DL">$20</a>) to test KaiOS 2.5 can play
      <tt>.MP3</tt> (music), <tt>.OOG</tt> (music), <tt>.MP4</tt>
      (videos), <tt>.GPP</tt> (videos), <tt>.OGV</tt> (videos),
      <tt>.GPP</tt> (videos), <tt>.JPEG</tt> (photos), <tt>.BMP</tt>
      (images) and <tt>.TXT</tt> (texts) file types.</p>
      <p>Maybe I am too much of a nerd, but I really like KaiOS 2.5 and
      my <a href="https://amzn.to/2ZAeKII" target="_blank"
      rel="nofollow" title="Alcatel A405DL">$20</a> <a
      href="https://amzn.to/2ZAeKII" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
      title="Alcatel A405DL">Alcatel A405DL</a>. By the way, if anyone
      wants to know why I get so excited about this technology, I like
      old technology. It has a <em>retro</em> look and feel.</p>

      <h2 id="Rumors">Rumors &amp; Future of KaiOS:</h2>
      <p>There are rumors going around concerning the future of KaiOS
      with Google's $22 million investment.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          There was an article indicating that Google had bought KaiOS
          to take over part or the whole feature phone market.
        </li>
        <li>
          Another article indicated that Google might persuade the
          developers of KaiOS to drop the Firefox browser in favor of
          Chrome or B2G in favor of some variation of <a
          href="/android.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
          title="Android">Android</a> or <a href="/chrome.html"
          target="_self" rel="dofollow" title="Chrome OS">Chrome OS</a>,
          for that matter, as the base of the OS.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>I hope the latter two rumors are fake. If KaiOS wants to
      continue making an impact, it should remain independent and not
      allow takeovers by any company, especially Google.</p>
      <section role="section">
        <h2 id="Installation">Installing KaiOS:</h2>
        <p>As with most mobile phones, there is no installation. There
        is no way for users to flash the ROM unless rooting it. As with
        other mobile devices, updates are pushed via firmware
        flashing.</p>

      <section role="section">
        <h2 id="VintageOS_app">Turning VintageOS into an HTML5 app:</h2>
        <p>As per the documentation to make apps for KaiOS, any website
        can become an app. I am currently making the proper changes to
        <a href="/" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title="VintageOS
        v5D8BBEDD">VintageOS</a>. If this works, the next project will
