      <h1 id="main">What is KERNAL?</h1>
      <p>KERNAL (not <em>kernel</em> and all upper case) is the OS that
      has ran on Commodore home computers (micros) since the
      introduction of the Personal Electronic Transactor (PET) in 1977
      although most of us only knew about <a href="/basic.html#CBM"
      target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What is Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code (BASIC) — Commodore BASIC?">
      CBM BASIC 2.0</a> running on ROM. At the time, most of us neither
      understood nor cared what an OS was. In general I wish I could
      say that I know more about KERNAL.</p>

      <p>As with most programmers who liked Commodore machines, I
      started writing code on a C64 and this was my only exposure to
      its built-in language interpreter ( <a href="/basic.html#CBM"
      target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What is Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code (BASIC) — Commodore BASIC?">
      CBM BASIC 2.0</a>) and its OS (KERNAL).</p>
    </article>
    <article role="article">
      <h2 id="C64">Commodore 64:</h2>
      <p>Although I enjoyed many hours of programming in <a href=
      "/basic.html#CBM" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What is Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code (BASIC) — Commodore BASIC?">
      CBM BASIC 2.0</a> including some machine language (lots of
      <tt>POKE</tt> calls) on my C64 (1982-94) not any other language,
      I now wish I knew then more about the OS underneath <a href=
      "/basic.html#CBM" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What is Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code (BASIC) — Commodore BASIC?">
      CBM BASIC 2.0</a>. Hence the only time I truly interacted with
      the OS was while programming <a href="/basic.html#CBM" target=
      "_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What is Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code (BASIC) — Commodore BASIC?">
      CBM BASIC 2.0</a> — in other words, merely basic code poking into
      the OS. At least, those hours of programming had me in front of
      my C64 connected to a cassette recorder and a B/W 13" Zenith TV
      set with a broken channel potentiometer (<em>pot</em> or knob)
      via an RF modulator on channel 3 (still no over-the-air channel 3
      where I live), a container of dry-roasted peanuts and a
      three-litter bottle of soda. At times, given the fact that my
      memory has flushed out almost everything I learned in <a href=
      "/basic.html#CBM" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What is Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code (BASIC) — Commodore BASIC?">
      CBM BASIC 2.0</a> more than three (3) decades ago, I wonder if I
      should once again learn how to program in <a href=
      "/basic.html#CBM" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What is Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code (BASIC) — Commodore BASIC?">
      CBM BASIC 2.0</a> accessing KERNAL with machine language as I
      used to do or perhaps this time writing directly to KERNAL in

      "What is Assembly?">assembly</a>.</p>
      <p>Although the original C64 has not been in production for
      almost three (3) decades, this has not stopped developers from
      working on new technologies retrofitted printed circuit boards
      (PCBs) to emulate hardware like FDDs, HDDs, modems and even NICs
      to access local networks or the internet. The same is true for
      new OSs as replacements for KERNAL — not to mention releasing new
      games for that matter.</p>

          by Daniel Dallman and others is an <em>"operating system for
          the Commodore64... [that] supports TCP/IP networking (SLIP or
          PPP using a RS232 interface)... [with] look and feel like
          <a href="/unix.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
          "What are UNIX® and Unix?">UNIX</a>"</em> (08/2013). Note
          that the RS232 (Recommended Standard 232) standard is for
          data transfer using serial ports commonly used in modems — in
          other words, network access.</p>

          <p id="WiNGs">WiNGs by Jolse Maginnis is a 16-bit and
          multi-tasking OS for the C64 and C128 with optional packages
          for the GUI, shell consoles and internet access. WiNGs needs
          a CMD SuperCPU (W65C816S 8/16-bit processor), CMD SuperRAM
          card with at least 1 MB, a CMD HD (if not a CBM 1351 floppy
          drive), IDE64 (SD external drive instead of a CMD HD), a CBM
          Mouse 1351 mouse for GUI, a CMD Turbo232 DUART cartridge and
          a Swiftlink or IDE64 DUART full duplex asynchronous
          communication (modem) for internet access (02/2020). WiNGs
          seems to be the most interesting OS in this short list, but
          all this hardware seems a bit too expensive for my taste. If
          you start buying all the extra hardware to operate a C64 as
          modern machine, you might as well get a new computer.</p>

      <p id="OpenCBM">Aside from OSs, there is also the OpenCBM
      project, which is a <em>"Win NT/2K/XP, and Linux/i386 kernel
      driver and development library to control serial CBM devices,
      such as the Commodore 1541 disk drive, connected to the PCs
      parallel port via a XM1541 or XA1541 cable. Fast disk copier
      included. Successor of cbm4li"</em> (06/2006).</p>
