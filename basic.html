      <h1 id="main">What is BASIC?</h1>
      <h2 id="subtitle">Although not an OS, but a complete instruction
      set nonetheless</h2>
      <p>BASIC (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) was
      released in 1964 at Dartmouth College. It was originally designed
      as the interactive mainframe timesharing programming language for
      the Dartmouth Time Sharing System (DTSS) OS by John Kem&eacute;ny
      and Thomas Kurtz. The original version of the language was later
      referred to as Dartmouth BASIC. For the next three (3) decades or
      so, BASIC became the <em>de facto</em> entry-level language by
      anyone interested in learning how to control computer systems. The
      updated version was referred to a Structured BASIC (SBASIC) in
      1975, which became the standard by the American National Standards
      Institute (ANSI) referred to Standard BASIC in the early
      1980s.</p>
      <p>In the late 1970s and throughout 1980s, BASIC was more than
      just an entry-level programming language. It was part of the
      instruction set for early home computers like the <a
      href="/basic.html#TRS80" target="_self" rel="dofollow"
      title="Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code
      (BASIC) &raquo; TRS80">TRS-80 Model III</a> running on the
      ROM-resident <a href="/dos.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow"
      title="Disk Operating System">TRSDOS</a> and the C64 running on
      ROM-resident KERNAL (misspelling of <em>kernel</em>).</p>
      <p>I remember reading lots of books on BASIC, machine language for
      the 64 and a handful of copies of <em>Byte Magazine</em> as well
      as watching <em>Bits and Bytes</em> (TVOntario) on WNET (1983). My
      experience at school was on a <a href="/basic.html#TRS80"
      target="_self" rel="dofollow" title="Beginner's All-purpose
      Symbolic Instruction Code (BASIC) &raquo; TRS80">TRS-80 Model
      III</a> without hard or floppy drives (1984) &mdash; no media to
      save any programs. At home, I spent many hours in front of my C64,
      on which I coded several programs that no longer exist (saved on
      cassette tape, which was an unreliable medium). The latter is the
      reason why, on this page, I can only concentrate on my experience
      of BASIC on my C64.</p>
    </article>
    <article role="article">
      <h2 id="C64">Commodore 64 &amp; BASIC 2.0:</h2>
      <p><a
      href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=17414886"
      target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img

      title="By Evan-Amos - Own work, Public Domain,
      https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=17414886"></a> The
      C64 was one of the first computer systems that I ever used and the
      first one I ever owned (spring 1984). I quickly got up hooked into
      a whole new field and style of life &mdash; <em>geekdom</em>
      &mdash; and coding into late hours of the night instead of
      sleeping. The experience of working with KERNAL (the OS), machine
      language (accessing KERNAL) and Commodore BASIC (programming) in
      its 8-bit glory boasting a 1.023 MHz MOS Technology 6510
      microprocessor and 64 KB of RAM was as fun as it could be for any
      kid in the early 1980s. To make things even more exciting and
      bringing more curious kids (like me at the time) to computer
      science, the C64 was heavily used for games and even some music
      programs thanks to its ground-breaking technology based on two
      chips by MOS Technology &mdash; SIC 6581 and VIC-II. Commodore
      International declared bankruptcy and closed shop in 1994.</p>
      <p>In 2011, Commodore USA, LLC, took over the Commodore brand name
      and released updated versions of the C64 (C64x) with the same
      vintage (old, obsolete, ancient, historical, <em>retro</em>)
      &quot;breadbox&quot; exterior and VIC 20 (VIC Slim) with their own
      <a href="/linux.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow"
      title="Linux">Linux</a> distribution named Commodore OS. I had not
      been thrilled about any new system and/or other technologies for a
      long time. The whole idea of reviving the C64x had me like a
      little kid before Christmas with a new toy wrapped in front of
      him, but I never bought one. Commodore USA closed shop a little
      after one of its owners died on 2013.</p>
      <p>In 2015, Commodore Business Machines Ltd (UK) took over the
      brand name and marketed mobile phones with the C64 look and feel
      rather than the classic C64 &quot;breadbox&quot; body.</p>
      <p>In 2018, Retro Games Ltd (UK) took over the rights to relive
      the heyday of the C64 (1982-85) with <em>The C64 MINI</em>
      marketed as a video game console with 64 built-in games and
      shipped with its own joystick, <em>THEC64</em> like the previous
      but with a working keyboard as well as a stand-alone joystick
      named <em>THEC64 Micro Switch Joystick</em>. The company has also
      released new version of the VIC20. All these machines, except for
      the stand-alone joystick, can also be used to program Commodore
      BASIC (forked from Microsoft BASIC) &mdash; the first programming
      language that I ever learned. If there was ever a computer I was
      excited about its launch, I would say is the C64. I want to get my
      hands on the new the C64, but first I want to make sure the new
      Commondore company will last. Needless to say, I am stoked.</p>

        20 PRINT "HELLO, "; NAME$;

        50 IF OK$ &lt;&gt; "OK" THEN PRINT "TOO BAD, "; NAME$; "! BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME!"
      </pre>
      <p>Another nostalgia option was Manomio's licensed emulator for <a
      href="/ios.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title="iOS">iOS</a>
      &mdash; <a href="/ios.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow"

      rel="dofollow" title="iOS">iPod</a> and <a href="/ios.html"
      target="_self" rel="dofollow" title="iOS">iPad</a>. This emulator
      was almost as good as the original the C64, but it was removed
      from the market without notice. I think someone might have
      considered it some sort of copyright violation.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately it has been over three (3) decades since I last
      coded my last program for the C64 and I can hardly remember how to
      code a quick and dirty (not to mention descent) program (excluding
      the <a href="/basic.html#OKAY.BAS" target="_self" rel="dofollow"

      &raquo; Commodore 64 &raquo; OKAY.BAS">one above</a> &mdash;
      <tt>OKAY.BAS</tt>), but I would consider it the <em>geekiest</em>
      purchase I have would ever make.</p>
      <p>Of course, if you are merely interested in C64 games, you can
      get a ROM emulator and a handful of ROM images, which may be
      illegal in some areas and/or under special conditions as explained

      <p>Although the original C64 has not been in production for almost

          16-bit and multi-tasking OS for the C64 and C128 with optional
          packages for the GUI, shell consoles and internet acceess.
          WiNGs needs a CMD SuperCPU (W65C816S 8/16-bit processor), CMD
          SuperRAM card with at least 1 MB, a CMD HD (if not a CBM 1351
          floppy drive), IDE64 (SD external drive instead of a CMD HD),
          a CBM Mouse 1351 mouse for GUI, a CMD Turbo232 DUART cartridge
          and a Swiftlink or IDE64 DUART full duplex asynchronous
          communication (modem) for internet access (Feb. 2020). WiNGs
          seems to be the most interesting OS in this short list, but
          all this hardware seems a bit too expensive for my taste. If
          you start buying all the extra hardware to operate a C64 as
          modern machine, you might as well get a new computer.</p>

      <h2 id="Installation">Installing BASIC:</h2>
      <p>BASIC on i286 and prior machines came burnt to a ROM chip.
      There is no way users could install BASIC. On boot, it loads from
      the built-in ROM to RAM. Later machines would run <a
      href="/dos.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title="Disk
      Operating System">DOS</a> and have BASIC as a stand-alone
      executable like <tt>QBASIC.EXE</tt> (Microsoft BASIC), but by no
      means being the similar instruction set of the late 1970s or
      1980s.</p>
      <p>Nowadays there are newer versions of BASIC that are installed
      as any other program would be on a computer via an excutable or
      script. For example, FreeBASIC is available for <a
