      <h1 id="main">Are There Other Operating Systems?</h1>
      <p>Developers keep making operating systems (OS'es) to call their
      own. Maybe out of pure vanity, they take pride of their programs
      and/or set of connected programs as an OS. To make the development
      of latter more interesting, there are groups and manuals how to
      write OS'es in different languages especially assembler, which I
      do not speak (understand). As a matter of fact, the development of
      hobby OS'es has caught my attention and has started my curiousity
      of learning assembler (<em>asm</em>), but I have no idea which
      assembler dialect &mdash; FASM, JWasm, MASM, YASM, etc. &mdash;
      would be best (easiest) for me.</p>
      <p>For the time being, I need to point out that these OS'es come
      in all forms and for every taste, size and hardware from the
      easiest to understand to most difficult to use. The following list
      of hobby and/or dedicated OS including microkernels is in
      alphabetical order &mdash; both vintage and cutting-edge.</p>
      <p id="flp">Note that some of these OS'es are available in images
      small enough to fit in a 1.44 MB floppy (usually <tt>.FLP</tt>).
      These OS'es hardly ever come with an installer to write the image
      to a hard drive. As such, you can to burn the image to a floppy
      using the <tt>dd</tt> command in <a href="/linux.html"
      target="_self" rel="dofollow" title="Linux">Linux</a> or <a
      href="/unix.html#Cygwin" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title="Unix
      &raquo; Unix Emulators &raquo; Cygwin">Unix</a> or a third-party
      application in <a href="/windows.html" target="_self"
      rel="dofollow" title="Microsoft Windows">Windows</a>.</p>
      <pre>
        dd if=os_image.flp of=/dev/fd0
      </pre>
      <p>You can mount the <tt>.FLP</tt> image to a virtual floppy drive
      using VirtualBox, Bochs or similar product &mdash; what I have
      done. Depending on the vendor and the version of the product, the
      instructions at this point will vary. You would need to refer to
      the vendor's documentation for detailed instructions.</p>
      <p>You can also burn the <tt>.ISO</tt> (if available) to a USB
      drive and boot your computer from it. Depending on the computer
      manufacturer and/or the BIOS developer, the procedure to boot to
      the USB drive will vary. You would need to refer to the
      manufacturer's documentation for detailed instructions.</p>
      <pre>
        dd if=os_image.iso of=/dev/sdb1
      </pre>
      <p>Of course, you can also mount the read-only <tt>.ISO</tt> image
      (if available) using VirtualBox, Bochs or similar product if have
      no intention of saving any data that you may write to RAM while
      testing the OS.</p>

        Control Program/Monitor and then it changed to Control Program

        target="_self" rel="dofollow" title="Unix">Unix</a> was released

        rel="dofollow" title="Disk Operating System">DOS</a> in the late
        1980's. Although there has not been much developement or any at
        all on the OS, CP/M is not considered obsolete thanks to many
        enthusiasts and its <a href="/bsd.html" target="_self"
        rel="dofollow" title="Berkeley Software
        Distribution">BSD</a>-like license. Since most machines in the
        market nowadays are x86, you should look into CP/M-86 3.1 if you
        would like to try this OS. Note that 86 refers to x86 chipsets,
        not the year, and 3.1 is the version of the OS. By the way, my
        only memory of CP/M was using WordStar to type some biology
        papers in high school.</p>

        rel="nofollow" title="KolibriOS">KolibriOS</a> is an x36 32-bit

        title="Other Operating Systems &raquo; MenuetOS">MenuetOS</a>,
        written in flat assembler (FASM) &mdash; heavily scaled down in
        order to use low resources. As such, the 1.41 MB <tt>.IMG</tt>
        file fits in a 1.44 MB floppy, that can be burned to floppy or
        mounted as a virtual drive. The full image available in an
        <tt>.ISO</tt> is under 70 MB and it also needs at least 8 MB of
        RAM to load the OS. In either case, KolibriOS is loaded
        completely to memory and not from disk to memory (no swapping).
        There is no installation and any change you make can be written
        back to the image &mdash; as long, as it is not the read-only
        <tt>.ISO</tt>. These changes cannot be written to the root of
        the image, but rather to one of the subdirectories in the image.
        One idea is <tt>/fd/1/SETTINGS/RAMDRIVE.BAK</tt> to keep all OS
        settings together and hence organized. The software bundled in
        the image is interesting to say the least. Its web browser
        WebView 2.65b is similar to Lynx, but in a modern GUI. KolibriOS
        also has its own Bash-like shell although limited to 28 external
        commands (excluding kernel commands). The image comes with
        several games, several emulators for several video game

        Although according its developing group this system is 93.8%
        complete, the current version is 0.4.13 (close to a decade in
        alpha). I have had fun with ReactOS even running a game engine.
        Unfortunately I have not been able to run emulators for any
        video game platforms like SNES (sorry, but no Zelda, why bother)
        that I have not been able to run due to failure to install
        missing libraries. Other than that, I do not know what else to
        do with it.</p>

        <p>Symbian was a mobile phone and real-time operating system
        (RTOS) from 1998 to 2013. This OS started as EPOC developed by
        Psion for their personal digital organizer (PDA). Most Symbian
        applications were written using the Qt framework, C, C++,
        Python, Java, Flash Lite, Ruby, .NET, web runtime (based on
        ActiveX) and WebKit for the built-in Opera web browser. In my
