      Code (BASIC)?</h1>
      <h2 id="subtitle">Not an OS, but a complete instruction set
      attached to the OS</h2>
      <p>BASIC (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) was
      released in 1964 at Dartmouth College. It was originally designed
      as the interactive mainframe time-sharing programming language
      for the Dartmouth Time Sharing System (DTSS) OS by Hungarian John
      Grorge Kemény (Kemény János György, pictured below) and Thomas
      Eugene Kurtz. The original version of the language was later
      referred to as Dartmouth BASIC.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="/img/John_George_Kemeny(edited).jpg"

      "By Source, Fair use, https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=33752493"></p>
      <p>For the fiftieth (50th) anniversary of the release of BASIC,
      Dartmouth University released a documentary appropriately called
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYPNjSoDrqw" target=
      "_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Birth of BASIC"><em>Birth of
      BASIC</em></a>. If you want a quick lesson on computer science
      history, I highly recommend it.</p>
      <p>For the next three (3) decades or so, BASIC became the <em>de
      facto</em> entry-level language for anyone interested in learning
      how to control computer systems. The updated version was referred
      to a Structured BASIC (SBASIC) in 1975, which became the standard
      by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) referred to
      Standard BASIC in the early 1980s.</p>
      <p>In the late 1970s and throughout 1980s, BASIC was more than
      just an entry-level programming language. In tandem with machine
      language to control the OS that the manufacturer had included,
      BASIC was part of the instruction set for early home computers
      like the <a href="/basic.html#TRS80" target="_self" rel=

      "What is Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code (BASIC) — Commodore 64 &amp; KERNAL?">
      KERNAL</a> (misspelling of <em>kernel</em>). Most importantly,
      BASIC was the only common factor in personal computers (8-bit
      microcomputers, latest technology at the moment) as binaries were
      not compatible from one manufacturer to another.</p>
      <p>By today's standards, the late 1970s and most of the 1980s
      were strange times when the OS of the machine was not as
      important as the manufacturer or the amount of RAM — the more
      RAM, the better. We expected the machine to have a built-in a
      BASIC interpreter even when we knew that a BASIC dialect might
      not be compatible from one manufacturer to another. At the same
      time, we were limited to the hardware and software available in
      the country or region where the user lived.</p>
      <p>For example, vendors and models in the UK were different from
      those in the US hence not sold, available or compatible in the US
      (PAL instead of NTSC, 50 Hz instead of 60 Hz alternate current).
      Because of the relation between England and the rest of the
      British Commonwealth, these units were also available in other
      countries like Australia and New Zealand.</p>

          as its software and its peripherals were made by or solely
          sold at Tandy/RadioShack, there was no need for third-party

          the quality of some software not be as popular as it could
          have been. In other words, sales of CoCo units could have
          been ever better.</p>

          <p>MSX was an attempt to standardize hardware so software
          written for one system (for example, Toshiba) would work for
          another (for example, Hitashi). It was the brainchild of
          Kazuhiko Nishi (ASCII Corporation & Microsoft) and Bill Gates
          (Microsoft). This meant that there was no need for choosing a
          vendor from another with different architectures as software
          and peripherals would work on any MSX <em>micro</em>. The MSX
          standardization was not a hit in the United States, but Japan
          was different. Right after, other markets worldwide followed
          — Asia (Korea), South America (Brazil and Chile), Europe
          (Netherlands, France, Spain and Finland) and the Soviet
          Union.</p>
          <p>The common MSX (worldwide, 1983) architecture was based on
          a 3.58 MHz Zilog Z80A CPU, at least 8 KB of RAM (most models
          shipped with 64 KB), 32 KB of ROM, a General Instrument
          AY-3-8910 3-voice programmable sound generator (PSG), 16 KB
          of VRAM and a Texas Instruments TMS-9918/9928/9929 video

          <p>Computer manufacturers worked around the MSX architecture
          to make themselves different from the others — more RAM, more
          VRAM, better sound chips, including internal FDDs, including
          internal HDDs or any other improvement that could mean better

          <p>I never knew of the MSX architecture or any of these

          C64</a> environment, I knew that computers were obsolete as
          soon as they hit the shelves and I had become fairly cynical
          about new technologies — not limited to <em>micros</em>,
          mainframes and midrange computers too. I am not sure if I
          would have bought one of a MSX machines. After all, most MSX
          machines were not sexy at all — nowhere near a <a href=

      <p>The C64 was one of the first computer systems that I ever used
      and the first one I ever owned (spring 1984). I quickly got up
      hooked into a whole new field and style of life —
      <em>geekdom</em> — and coding into late hours of the night
      instead of sleeping. The experience of working with <a href=

      boasting a 1.023 MHz MOS CPU Technology 6510 microprocessor and
      64 KB of RAM was as fun as it could be for any kid in the early
      1980s. To make things even more exciting and bringing more
      curious kids (like me at the time) to computer science, the C64
      was heavily used for games and even some music programs thanks to
      its ground-breaking technology based on two chips by MOS
      Technology — SIC 6581 and VIC-II. Commodore International
      declared bankruptcy and closed shop in 1994.</p>

      <p>In 2011, Commodore USA, LLC, took over the Commodore brand
      name and released updated versions of the C64 (C64x) with the
      same vintage (old, obsolete, ancient, historical, <em>retro</em>)
      "breadbox" exterior and VIC 20 (VIC Slim) with their own <a href=
      "/linux.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What is Linux?">Linux</a> distribution named Commodore OS. I had
      not been thrilled about any new system and/or other technologies
      for a long time. The whole idea of reviving the C64x had me like
      a little kid before Christmas with a new toy wrapped in front of
      him, but I never bought one. Commodore USA closed shop a little
      after one of its owners died on 2013.</p>
      <p>In 2015, Commodore Business Machines Ltd (UK) took over the
      brand name and marketed mobile phones with the C64 look and feel
      rather than the classic C64 "breadbox" body.</p>
      <p>In 2018, Retro Games Ltd (UK) took over the rights to relive
      the heyday of the C64 (1982-85) with <em>The C64 MINI</em>
      marketed as a video game console with 64 built-in games and
      shipped with its own joystick, <em>THEC64</em> like the previous
      but with a working keyboard as well as a stand-alone joystick
      named <em>THEC64 Micro Switch Joystick</em>. The company has also
      released new version of the VIC20. All these machines, except for
      the stand-alone joystick, can also be used to program Commodore
      BASIC (forked from Microsoft BASIC) — the first programming
      language that I ever learned. If there was ever a computer I was
      excited about its launch, I would say it is the C64. I want to
      get my hands on the new the C64, but first I want to make sure
      the new Commodore company will last. Needless to say, I am
      stoked.</p>

      <p id="C65">In 1990 or 1991, Commodore came up with a prototypes
      for the Commodore 65 (probably just a prototype name). Being a
      prototype, only few units exist and one of these units could
      easily sell in an auction for close to 47,000€ (about $49,500).
      The C65 boasted a 3.54 MHz 16-bit CSG 4510 CPU (compared to the 1
      MHz CPU in C64) combined with two MOS 6526 chips, Universal
      Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) serial interface, 1 MB
      of RAM mapping (depending on RAM expansion), a VIC-III graphics
      chip (256 colors, 40/80×25 text), CSG 8580R5 SID chips capable of
      independent outputs (stereo), 128 KB of RAM built-in (1 MB
      maximum via an expansion port), CBM-BASIC 10.0 (not version 2.0
      as in the C64) and built-in 3.5" double-sided disk density (DSDD)

      the new CPU), 384 KB of fast RAM (old CBM hardware) and 8 MB of

      Maybe the MEGA65 is sold as a kit to lower costs or to avoid
      legalities. In either case, this kit is for anyone with a
      background in computers and programming including assembly. It
      seems that the only difference between the MEGA65 and the

      not find this in the system specifications (specs). If you have a

      <h2 id="Installation">Installing BASIC:</h2>
      <p>BASIC on i286 and prior machines came burnt to a ROM chip.
      There is no way users could install BASIC other than changing the
      ROM chips. On boot, it loads from the built-in ROM to RAM. Later
      machines would run <a href="/dos.html" target="_self" rel=
      "dofollow" title="What is Disk Operating System (DOS)?">DOS</a>
      and have BASIC as a stand-alone executable like
      <tt>QBASIC.EXE</tt> (Microsoft BASIC), but by no means being the
      similar instruction set of the late 1970s or 1980s.</p>
      <p>Nowadays there are newer versions of BASIC that are installed
      as any other program would be on a computer via an executable or
      script. For example, FreeBASIC is available for <a href=
      "/dos.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=

      <h2 id="16bit">No More BASIC, 16-Bit Microcomputers:</h2>
      <p>When 16-bit computers became mainstream in the late 1980s,
      BASIC was no longer intertwined with the OS and programming no
      longer was the main purpose of computers. In most OSs, BASIC was
      just reduced as a stand-alone binary like GW-BASIC (numbering
      each line, Microsoft, 1983-88) or QBasic (structured programming,
      Microsoft, 1991-present). Slowly BASIC was removed from OS
      distributions like <a href="/windows.html" target="_self" rel=

      <h2 id="Affair">The BASIC Love Affair with 8-Bit Micros:</h2>
      <p>Most nerds (myself included) who grew up with <em>micros</em>
      (1977-95) love these machines. More than nostalgia, it is a love
      affair or even a sub-culture (<em>cult</em>, as in cultural).
      This is the reason why there is a whole market of second-hand
      8-bit <em>micros</em> and modern hardware that can be connected
      to the old hardware like HDDs and FDD emulators, hardware
      replacement and upgrades to bypass the original like sound and
      video cards, wireless adapters, PAL to NTSC converters and such.
      As a matter of fact, Tandy/RadioShack, Commodore, Atari, Acorn
      and Sinclair <em>micros</em> (including non-licensed USSR clones)
      are some of the best selling units in the second-hand market
      (eBay, etc.) with prices ranging from $100 to $500 bare-bones.
      Even 16-bit <em>micros</em> like the line of Commodore Amiga can
      easily sell from $200 to $1,000. Software, original monitors and
      peripherals can also demand high prices depending on manufacturer
      and rarity. Brand new (never open, often referred to a new old
      stock) vintage machines can sell for thousands. Of course, these
      prices are usually for mass-produced micros. Prototypes like
      <a href="/basic.html#C65" target="_self" rel="nofollow" title=
      "What is Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code (BASIC) — Commodore 64?">
      C65</a> can demand 47,000€ (about $49,500) in auction.</p>

      <h2 id="SymbOS">Z80 & SymbOS:</h2>
      <p>Most 8-bit <em>micros</em> ran on the Zilog Z80 CPU
      architecture, which hit the market in 1976. In 2006, German
      developer Jörn "Prodatron" Mika released SymbOS. The latter is a
      multitasking OS that runs on Z80 chips as replacement to the
      built-in OS of a given computer with a GUI similar to <a href=
