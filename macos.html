      is <a href="/bsd.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What is Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD)?">FreeBSD</a> with
      a modified (hacked) GNU Mach kernel, which is not accessible
      off-hand. The end user interacts only with the Aqua GUI and has
      no access to directories in the system other than the
      <tt>home</tt> (<tt>~</tt>) subdirectory. macOS is fairly closed
      only allowing applications from the Mac App Store or identified
      developers. This limitation is disappointing and annoying
      considering the high cost of MacBooks and other Apple products
      even if done for the purpose of security or as an expansion of
      the <a href="/ios.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What is iPhone OS (iOS)?">iOS</a> heavily restricted system
      mentality.</p>
      <p>Since I got my second-hand MacBook running macOS Catalina
      (version 10.15, released on 10/07/2019) with the purpose of
      learning the OS and for programming, I installed the <a href=
      "https://brew.sh/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=
      "Homebrew">Homebrew</a> package manager in order to install
      different applications like LibreOffice, Anaconda, MariaDB,
      DBeaver and PyCharm for Python3 — most of which are not available
      in the Mac App Store.</p>
      <pre>
        <!-- *spacer* -->
        /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
      </pre>
      <p>I had to install <tt>ranger</tt> — a CLI file explorer to see
      the contents of directories outside <tt>home</tt> via the
      terminal (<tt>zch</tt>).</p>
      <pre>
        <!-- *spacer* -->
        brew install ranger
      </pre>
      <p>I dare say that I am disappointed. If I wanted to be limited
      by an OS and only able to see the contents of my <tt>home</tt>
      directory, I would have opted for another <a href=
      "/chromeos.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What is chromeOS?">chromeOS</a> laptop or set up <a href=
      "/bsd.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What is Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD)?">FreeBSD</a> again
      after more than a decade — this time on a VDI rather than on
      barebone hardware.</p>
      <p>At least, I can use my MacBook to rewrite the curriculum for
      the SQL classes I teach. I want to move away from Microsoft SQL
      Server and into MariaDB since many students have MacBooks of
      their own.</p>
      <article role="article">
        <h2 id="History">History:</h2>
        <p id="1981">The story of the macOS is the story of Apple, the
        company and its philosophy, not only the development of
        Macintosh System 1. In 1976, Steve Jobs and Steve
        <em>"Woz"</em> Wozniak started Apple. By 1981, they had
        released several systems that were able to understand <a href=
        "/dos.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
        "What is Disk Operating System (DOS)?">DOS</a> running ProDOS
        and <a href="/basic.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
        "What is Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code (BASIC)?">
        Applesoft BASIC</a>.</p>
        <p id="1982">In 1982, Apple was working on a new kind of OS and
        found PARC from Xerox, Palo Alto, California. They were making
        a new type of OS that used a graphical user interface (GUI) and
        not only text. Apple's co-founder Jobs offered them some of
        Apple's stock for the rights to the OS. Since Xerox main office
        refused the OS, they gladly agreed to do so in 1982.</p>
        <p id="1983">In January 1983, Apple released two systems. One
        of them was the Apple Lisa, that ran Lisa OS and Lisa Office
        System. Named after Job's daughter, the Lisa was $9,995 so not
        many people bought it, but Apple knew the idea was good and
        continued development. The other system was the Apple IIe for
        $1,395.</p>
        <p id="1984">In 1984, Apple decided to release the Macintosh
        128k (Macintosh 1.0; commonly referred to as Mac) for $2,495,
        much cheaper and had more applications than the Lisa. About
        that time, Apple had Microsoft develop some software for Mac,
        but they borrowed their idea and came out with <a href=
        "/windows.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
        "What is Microsoft Windows?">Windows</a> shortly after, a big
        mistake from Apple.</p>

        <p id="1985">In 1985, the Lisa 2 and System 2.0 were released.
        Apple lost its founders, Wozniak in February and Jobs in
        September. Jobs started a new computer company called NeXT with
        the dream of changing the world, by having a great and sleek
        looking computer in a black case. The NeXT computer and NeXT
        operating systems were great but sold poorly. The NeXT would
        help Jobs and Apple make the Mac OS X, based on <a href=
        "/bsd.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
        "What is Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD)?">FreeBSD</a> (a
        project known as <a href="/bsd.html#Darwin" target="_self" rel=

        "What is Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) — Darwin?">Darwin</a>).</p>
        <p id="1986">In 1986, Apple released the Mac OS 3.0 in January,
        3.1 in February and 3.2 in June. Japanese and Arabic versions
        of Macintosh were introduced.</p>
        <p id="1987">In 1987, Mac OS 3.3 was released in January with
        AppleShare (proprietary protocol). About the same time,
        AppleShare file server was also released. Apple also released
        Mac OS 4.0 in March, 4.1 in April, 4.2 (Software 5.0) in
        October and Software 5.1 in November.</p>
        <p id="1988">In 1988, Apple once again foresaw its own future
        with <a href="/unix.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
        "What are UNIX® and Unix?">Unix</a>, releasing A/UX (Apple
        Unix) in February. Apple released System 6.0. Mac OS 6 was a
        great OS and many artists and musicians bought it. On the
        hardware side, FDHD (SuperDrive, high-density floppy drive) was
        released with the Apple IIx and SE 2/40. Former co-founder of
        Apple, Steve Jobs released the first NeXT system called the
        NeXTcube.</p>
        <p id="1989">In 1989, the first 32-bit Mac system was released,
        the Mac IIci. That same year Microsoft was working on the Intel
        16-bit i486 microprocessor to release Windows 3.0 the following
        year. That same year, the first Apple portable system was
        released, the system ($6,500). Still trying to make on his own,
        Steve Jobs released the next generation of the NeXT system
        called the NeXTstep.</p>
        <p id="1981">In 1991, Apple released the <em>"most used Classic
        Mac OS"</em>, 7.0. This allowed users to have more performance
        from their Macintosh systems. QuickTime was also introduced
        this year.</p>
        <p id="1992">In 1992, Mac 7.1 was released facing competition
        from <a href="/windows.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow"
        title="What is Microsoft Windows?">Windows 3.1</a> and NeXTstep
        3.0 and NeXTstep.</p>

        <p id="1993">In 1993, Apple released the first Newton
        (hand-held device) in August and Mac 7.1 Pro in October.</p>
        <p id="1994">In 1994, Mac 7.5 was released in June. Compatible
        with <a href="/dos.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
        "What is Disk Operating System (DOS)?">DOS</a> continued with
        610 and 6100 systems. Aside from end user systems, Apple
        continued supporting work groups with the Workgroup Server
        6150, 8150 and 9150.</p>
        <p id="1995">In 1995, legal Mac clones were released.</p>
        <p id="1996">In 1996, Apple released Mac 7.5.5 in October and
        buys NeXT in December. The purchase of NeXT was one Apple's
        best decisions ever bringing Steve Jobs back to the company
        that he created.</p>
        <p id="1997">In 1997, Mac 7.6 was released in January. Job came
        back to Apple originally as an advisor in January and then as
        the CEO in September.</p>
        <p id="1998">In 1998, Newton is discontinued. Apple released
        Mac 8.1 and the iMac in August with a very unique advertising
        campaign asking people to switch to the Mac OS. iMac became the
        most sold personal computer in history making 1997 the most
        profitable year since 1985. In October, Mac 8.1 was
        released.</p>
        <p id="1999">In 1999, Apple released Mac X Server in March and
        Mac 8.6 in April. Although that year the computer market had
        AMD push the 800 MHz mark (Intel not that far behind), the
        fastest Mac only had a 500 MHz. In a market that dominated by
        the speed of the microprocessor, Apple still held a descent
        market share.</p>
        <p id="2000">In 2000, the Power Mac G4 Cube was released. The
        unit was different than the bulky computers many manufacturers
        were introducing to the market. The G4 Cube looked cool. Like
        many sports cars, it looked good, but it was impractical. That
        same year, Apple released a Beta version of Mac OS X in
        September.</p>
        <p id="2001">In 2001, Apple released the highly anticipated
        <a href="/unix.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=

        Mac OS X 10.1 (Puma) in September. Apple also released the
        Power Mac G4 with 733 MHz, 867 MHz or dual 800 MHz
        microprocessors. Apple released iPod, the music device that
        changed the music industry and redefined <em>cool</em> in
        November, just in time for the Holiday season (great
        marketing).</p>
        <p id="2002">In 2002, the first 1 GHz Power Mac G4 was released
        (actually dual 1 GHz) in January. That same year, Intel
        released microprocessors running at 3.06 GHz. Apple also
        released iPod for <a href="/windows.html" target="_self" rel=

        <p id="2003">In 2003, Mac OS X 10.2.4 was released in February
        followed by Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther) in October. The iTunes
        Store opened in April with 13,000,000 songs sold by October.
        Several companies have tried to sell music on-line, but have
        fallen short.</p>

        Apple reported selling 100,000,000 songs sold by July 2004 and
        1,000,000 videos sold by October 2005 through the iTunes
        Store.</p>
        <p id="2005">On April 2005, Apple released Mac OS X 10.4

        daemons). On June of the same year, Apple opted to port its OS
        to Intel microprocessors, phasing out port microprocessors by
        the end of 2007.</p>
        <p id="2007">On October 2007, Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) was
        released. Since that same year, Apple has created a variety of
        products that have gotten people devoted to its brand name —
        iPod, iPhone and as of late iPad (almost a cult), which sold
        over two million units in two months. This had been a great
        success for Apple's new OS — <a href="/ios.html" target="_self"
        rel="dofollow" title="What is iPhone OS (iOS)?">iOS</a>.</p>
        <p id="2009">On August 2009, Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) was

        <p id="2013">As of October 2013, Apple decided to offer their
        OS updates for free of charge starting with Mac OS X 10.9
        (Mavericks). Note that this practice started with <a href=

        "What is iPhone OS (iOS)?">iOS</a> in 2007.</p>
        <p id="2015">As of June 2015, Apple changed the name of their
        OS to macOS to match the names of other Apple products like iOS
        and iPad.</p>

        <h2 id="Installation">Installing macOS:</h2>
        <p>Unfortunately image do not have any experience installing
        the older versions or macOS X (<a href="/bsd.html#Darwin"
        target="_self" rel="nofollow" title=

        Therefore I would recommend reading <em><a href=

        <p>Of course, you can always opt for a <em>hackintosh</em>
        project if you really want to learn how to install macOS on new
        hardware (non-Apple, Intel-based hardware or no-longer
        supported Apple hardware (<em>dosdude1</em>'s OS patches). For
        some reason, I am not eager to learn how to install macOS after
        feeling disappointed at the lack access the end user has over a
        computer he/she spends lots of money for. In other words, macOS
        feels like too much hype.</p>
