      <blockquote>
        <em>"We believe that OS/2 is the platform for the
        90s."</em><br>
        — Bill Gates
      </blockquote>
      <p id="1987">OS/2 stands for Operating System/2. IBM and
      Microsoft developed MS OS/2 in 1987, the first version of this
      16-bit multi-tasking system that was intended to replace <a href=
      "/dos.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What is Disk Operating System (DOS)?"></a> and <a href=
      "/windows.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What is Microsoft Windows?">Windows 3.x</a>. Microsoft took part
      of the code to develop <a href="/windows.html" target="_self"
      rel="dofollow" title="What is Microsoft Windows?">Windows NT
      3.x</a>. IBM continued with the development of OS/2 till
      1997/2000 releasing versions 2 to 4, which are 32-bit systems.
      Version 3 and 4 were released under the name OS/2 Warp.</p>

      "By Source, Fair use, https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=18849795"></p>
      <p id="1994">My experiences with OS/2 are limited to Warp 3
      (1994), which is probably one of the ones I have ever had with
      any OS. It never crashed on me and that is more than I can say
      about every other OS that I have ever used other than <a href=
      "/dos.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What is Disk Operating System (DOS)?">DOS</a>. OS/2 has the same
      feeling as <a href="/windows.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow"
      title="What is Microsoft Windows?">Windows 3.11</a> or <a href=
      "/linux.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What is Linux?">Linux 1.3</a> with a chunky taskbar floating on
      the screen. OS/2 Warp 3 came in two <em>flavors</em> — blue and
      red spines. The red spine version fully supported installing
      <a href="/windows.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What is Microsoft Windows?">Windows 3.11</a> under it and the
      blue spine offering no support.</p>
      <p id="2000">By 2000, the development of this project was picked
      up by Serenity Systems International under the name eComStation,
      which kept its GUI similar to the X Windows System.</p>
      <p id="2005">On December 2005, IBM discontinued the development
      of OS/2. Many people think that the lack of interest to this OS
      is the result of weak North American promotion. OS/2 is more
      popular in Europe than in the US. Many of the sites that I have
      visited are in Russia and/or Germany.</p>
      <p id="2015">On November 2015, <a href="https://arcanoae.com/"
      target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="ArcaOS">Arca Noae</a>
      (project <em>Blue Lion</em>) as a distribution based on OS/2 Warp
      4 under license from IBM — not based on eComStation.</p>
      <p id="2017">In April 2017, Blue Lion was released as ArcaOS 5.0
      (OS/2 5.0). There is no clear explanation what is going to happen
      to license and production of eComStation with the licensing and
      release of ArcaOS 5.0. Perhaps OS/2 will become the next <a href=
      "/linux.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What is Linux?">Linux</a>, where multiple companies and/or
      organizations can release custom distribution as long as IBM
      signs of the proper license.</p>
    </article>
    <article role="article">
      <h2 id="Installation">Installing OS/2:</h2>
      <p>installing OS/2 Warp 3 is a simple. Just insert each one of
      the floppies and follow the instructions on the screen — fairly
      fool-proof.</p>
      <p>For my project, I installed OS/2 Warp 3 (red spine, 1994) on
      an IBM PS/2 Model 90 PC (1993) that I had. I could have used my
      1997 IBM Aptiva E26 or another PC, but IBM PS/2 Model 90 was sold
      with OS/2 or <a href="/windows.html" target="_self" rel=
      "dofollow" title="What is Microsoft Windows?">Windows 3.11</a>.
      My decision was purely sentimental.</p>
      <p>I never had a chance to play around with Warp 3 was year 2000
      complaint and this meant installing numerous patches. In the
      other hand, OS/2 Warp 4 (available on CD-ROM, no need for
      floppies) was Y2K-complaint and supports speech recognition. This
      version was marketed emphasizing on this issue and often used in
      telephony, especially voicemail servers.</p>
      <p>In the case of eComStation (eCS) or ArcaOS 5.0, follow the
      instructions of the installation disk and booting with it.
      Unfortunately I have not been able to get my hands on either.</p>
