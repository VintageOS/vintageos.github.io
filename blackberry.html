      https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=11073353"></a> The
      BlackBerry OS only runs on BlackBerry devices. Hence when
      mentioning the name BlackBerry one can refer to either the OS
      and/or its hardware.</p>
      <p>When BlackBerry first came out (1999), the system was designed
      as a two-way pager with a real (not on-screen) QWERTY keyboard,
      which could receive and send email through its proprietary
      protocol and email relay service.</p>
      <p>In 2002, Blackberry released its first mobile phones, fax
      capability, push-to-talk (PTT, sort of a walkie-talkie service
      fairly common at the time by different vendors), SMS and even a
      web browser for internet access. By this time, BlackBerry
      supported third-party applications, Java support, voice
      recognition and a built-in photo/video camera.</p>
      <p>In 2003, Blackberry released a line touch screen devices and
      the virtual keyboard concept rather than the physical
      keyboard.</p>
      <p>The BlackBerry OS was a fairly robust product although I
      trashed the system configuration &mdash; not the OS itself &mdash;
      of my first unit several times and practically destroyed the
      hardware of a second unit. The last model I used before I started
      using <a href="/android.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow"
      title="Android">Android</a> was BlackBerry OS 4.6.1.259 with
      kernel 3.8.5.50a &mdash; no idea what these numbers mean in terms
      of the OS and its related technologies.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the biggest plus (biggest sales pitch, for that matter)
      was the email service that allowed a BlackBerry device to send and
      receive corporate emails &mdash; a huge innovation at the time. Of
      course, having a physical QWERTY keyboard came very handy although
      it only has 35 keys, over 100 characters or less depending on
      model using <tt>ALT</tt> (alternate) and <tt>SYM</tt> (symbol)
      keys helped too.</p>
      <p>What caught my attention at the time was the resolution for
      such a small screen (about 2.5&quot;) with a resolution of 320x240
      (65,000 colors, not shabby at all) to watch videos, read e-books
      using Mobipocket or go on-line using Opera Mini, (instead of its
      default web browser) via 802.11b/g connection.</p>
      <p>BlackBerry is a pretty descent OS tightly intertwined to the
      hardware that it was coded and/or configured for. Nonetheless I
      should point out is that once in a while you need to do a cold
      boot removing the battery to clean zombies (not to be confused
      with viruses) in RAM or memory overflows or other garbage data
      although it has <tt>Memory Cleaner</tt> (utility to clean up
      temporary data) that is not turned on by default.</p>
      <p>I never studied the inner workings of the OS. As a matter of
      fact, I am not sure where I could read about it, but I should
      point out that some of these units are more powerful &mdash;
      higher microprocessor speed and RAM &mdash; than some of the
      desktops or laptops that I have owned. It is exciting having that
      much power in a device that fits in my hands.</p>
      <p>The OS is closed, practically no access for the user. I never a
      way to explore its configuration or any system files, but that no
      longer matters.</p>
      <p id="Directories">The tree structure is similar to <a
      href="/unix.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow"
      title="Unix">Unix</a> as seen below.</p>

        </pre>
      <p>Note that the memory card (microSD) is mounted at the root as
      <tt>Media Card</tt>. Only in <tt>Media Card</tt>, the user has
      access to create, hide (changing attributes) and delete
      directories other than the ones needed by the system. Some program
      installations also write data to <tt>Media Card</tt>. In any
      event, mobile phones can be mounted as external disks via USB
      connection.</p>
      <p>One thing that I find fairly strange is that notes, tasks,
      calendar, contact and all configuration data is stored in the
      mobile phone and not in the microSD &mdash; not even transferable.
      In order to copy this data, one has to sync the mobile phone with
      a desktop using a proprietary code application. System
      configuration and user data are stored as a backup files, which
      can be used to restore the system or to transfer configuration
      files to another BlackBerry device.</p>
      <p>One way a user can have some access to the system is via its
      Java VM. BlackBerry OS provides an SDK to code programs accessing
      all hardware including the trackball and as of late its
      touchpad.</p>
