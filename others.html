      <h1 id="main">Are there other operating systems?</h1>
      <p>Developers keep making operating systems (OSs) to call their
      own. Maybe out of pure vanity, they take pride of their programs
      and/or set of connected programs as an OS. To make the
      development of latter more interesting, there are groups and
      manuals how to write OSs in different languages especially
      assembler, which I do not speak (understand).</p>
      <p>As a matter of fact, the development of hobby OSs has caught
      my attention and has started my curiosity of learning assembler
      (<em>asm</em>), but I have no idea which assembler dialect would

      <p>For the time being, I need to point out that these OSs come in
      all forms and for every taste, size and hardware from the easiest
      to understand to most difficult to use. The following list of
      hobby and/or dedicated OS including <a href=
      "/others.html#Microkernel" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "Other Operating Systems » Microkernel">microkernels</a>
      (µkernels) is in alphabetical order — both vintage and
      cutting-edge, most of which I have fully tested.</p>
      <article role="article">
        <h2 id="Kernels">Monolithic kernels vs. µkernels:</h2>
        <p>When referring to OSs, a kernel is smallest section of code
        that is considered the OS itself — its brain that manages
        system calls, process management, concurrency (running multiple
        threads of a job without asynchronously), memory management,
        file system and device (hardware) drivers. Kernels are loaded
        completely to RAM and need to run throughout the whole session.
        There are two distinct groups of kernels depending how much
        control the kernel really has.</p>
        <ul>
          <li id="Monolithic">Monolithic kernels have full control of
          system, processes, threads, RAM and device driver management.
          All functions take place inside the kernel. A good example is
          the <a href="/linux.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow"
            title="Linux">Linux</a> kernel, which is the OS itself.
            <a href="/linux.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
            "Linux">Linux</a> distributions (<em>distros</em>) are
            built on top of the kernel.
          </li>
          <li id="Microkernel">Microkernels (µkernels) have the least
          amount of control possible. Usually of file system, device
          drivers and other aspects of the OS are handled outside the
          kernel. A good example include any real-time operating system
          (RTOS) currently in the market, which are small enough to use
          the least amount of RAM — for example, in microcontrollers
          and robotics.</li>
        </ul>
      </article>
      <article role="article">
        <h2 id="Images">Images: discs and floppies</h2>
        <p>Note that some of OSs covered on the list below are
        available in images small enough to fit in a 1.44 MB floppy
        (usually <tt>.FLP</tt>). These OSs hardly ever come with an
        installer to write the image to a hard drive.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>As such, you can burn the image to a floppy using the
          <tt>dd</tt> command in <a href="/linux.html" target="_self"
          rel="dofollow" title="Linux">Linux</a> or <a href=
          "/unix.html#Cygwin" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
          "Unix » Unix Emulators » Cygwin">Cygwin</a> or a third-party
          application like UNetbootin for <a href="/windows.html"

          "Microsoft Windows">Windows</a> or <a href="/linux.html"

            <pre>
              <!-- *spacer* -->
              dd if=floppy_image.flp of=/dev/fd0
            </pre>
          </li>
          <li>You can mount the <tt>.FLP</tt> image to a virtual floppy
          drive using VirtualBox, Bochs or similar product — what I
          have done. Depending on the vendor and the version of the
          product, the instructions at this point will vary. You would
          need to refer to the vendor's documentation for detailed
          instructions.</li>
          <li>You can burn the <tt>.ISO</tt> (if available) to a USB
          drive and boot your computer from it. Depending on the
          computer manufacturer and/or the BIOS developer, the
          procedure to boot to the USB drive will vary. You would need
          to refer to the manufacturer's documentation for detailed
          instructions.
            <pre>
              <!-- *spacer* -->
              dd if=disc_image.iso of=/dev/sdb1
            </pre>
          </li>
          <li>Of course, you can also mount the read-only <tt>.ISO</tt>
          image (if available) using VirtualBox, Bochs or similar
          product if you have no intention of saving any data that you
          may write to RAM while testing the OS.</li>

              The OS can run with minimal system requirements — for
              example, the 3.5 MHz Z80 chip in Sinclair ZX Spectrum
              (1982), the 2 MHz Z80A chip in <a href=

              that <em>"contains everything that a post-collapse

              whole idea as explained by the developers is to be able
              to run computer systems to rebuild the computer-based
              civilization that we are used to even if this means no
              GUI. It sounds exciting and an imperative need to learn
              in case civilization does collapse, but I had not yet had
              the opportunity to play with this OS.</p>

              2004, written in FASM (flat assembler) — heavily scaled
              down in order to use low resources. As such, the 1.41 MB
              <a href="/others.html#Images" target="_self" rel=
              "dofollow" title=
              "Other Operating Systems » Images">image</a>
              (<tt>.IMG</tt>) fits in a 1.44 MB floppy, that can be
              burned to floppy or mounted as a virtual drive. The full
              image available in an <tt>.ISO</tt> is under 70 MB and it
              also needs at least 8 MB of RAM to load the OS. I would
              recommend at least 128 MB of RAM to run most
              applications. In either case, the whole OS (not only the
              kernel) is loaded to memory and not from disk to memory
              (no swapping). There is no installation and any change
              you make can be written back to the image — not to root
              (<tt>/</tt>), but rather to one of the subdirectories in
              the image. One idea is
              <tt>/fd/1/SETTINGS/RAMDRIVE.BAK</tt> to keep all OS
              settings together and hence organized. The software
              bundled in the image is interesting to say the least. Its
              web browser WebView 3.66-3 is similar to Lynx, but with a
              modern GUI. KolibriOS also has its own Bash-like shell
              although limited to 28 external commands (excluding
              kernel commands) simply called <tt>Shell 0.8.3</tt> in
              Kolibri 0.7.7.0 (current version as of 06/10/2022) with
              kernel SUN-rev 9832 (no idea what SUN means in the name
              of the kernel). The image comes with several games,
              several emulators for several video game platforms like
              SNES and even <a href="/dos.html#DOSBox" target="_self"

              is forked from a previous version of MikeOS, 4.5 rather

              Saunders and others. This OS (currently 4.6.1) has low
              system requirements — i386, keyboard, no mouse and 1 MB

              that some of these files are not accessible as in the
              case of <tt>KERNEL.BIN</tt> since it is a system file.
              What I do not understand is why the file is not hidden in
              the first place. Part of the idea behind MikeOS is
              teaching how simple a 16-bit OS works with lots of
              documentation to study and learn from. The MikeOS website
              has a collection of applications for download including a

              <p>Phantom OS is an real-time operating system (RTOS)
              running from VM loaded to RAM. The selling point of the
              OS is that it constantly saves a snapshot of what it is
              doing. It achieves this by paging a content in RAM
              <em>"to disk in a way that lets OS to restore whole
              memory image on restart"</em> (Nov. 2020). This way in
              the case of power failure the machine can pick up where
              it left off.</p>

              one of the strangest and possibly the less visually
              appealing OSs ever created. This OS was written by Terry
              Davis (1969-2018), who had been diagnosed with mental

              Holy-C, and assembler. Using the OS is difficult unless

              <p>Tizen is an Internet of things (IoT) OS (Linux

              summarized as an annoyance with a poor software library
              other than a handful of streaming services on a Samsung
              smart TV, which I returned the following day. I cannot
              believe that Samsung uses Tizen as the OS to power their
              TV sets. Samsung CRT TV sets were good and robust, but
              nowadays in the age of smart TV sets Samsung made a dumb
              move. Given the chance, I would opt for <a href=

              source</a> OS written in C — not assembler as most OSs in
              this list — by João Costa (a.k.a. <em>YuukiDesu9</em> or
              simply <em>Yuuki</em>) that runs from its <a href=
              "/others.html#Images" target="_self" rel="dofollow"
              title="Other Operating Systems » Images">floppy-sized
              image</a> — no installation. Since Costa is the lead and
              practically sole programmer, the development of this
              hobby OS is a tad slow. yuuOS reminds of <a href=
              "/others.html#BOS" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
              "Other Operating Systems » BOS">BOS</a> — also on this
              list — with its menu at the top prompting users to type
              the commands at the bottom of the screen without any
              means to recall the previous commands like
              <tt>DOSKEY.EXE</tt>.</p>
