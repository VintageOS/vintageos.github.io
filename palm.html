      <h1 id="main">What is Palm OS?</h1>
      <p id="2005">On late September 2005, Microsoft and Palm agreed to
      sell new smart mobile phones with Pocket PC rather than the Palm
      OS. On November 2005, PalmSource (the developer of the operating
      systems) was acquired by Access.</p>

      "By Coplan at English Wikipedia — Transferred from en.wikipedia to Commons by Liftarn using CommonsHelper., Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=11904323"></p>
      <p id="2006">On June 2006, Access decided to drop Palm OS in
      favor of Access Linux Platform (ALP, a defunct <a href=
      "/linux.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What is Linux?">Linux</a> variation).</p>
      <p id="2010">In April 2010, Hewlett-Packard (HP) acquired Palm
      and all related properties. The new product release is webOS,
      which based on <a href="/linux.html" target="_self" rel=
      "dofollow" title="What is Linux?">Linux</a> marking an end to
      Palm OS.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, Palm OS is an operating systems for hand-held
      computers that is very easy to use and to share data with any
      other PC, compared to the installation procedure of the
      synchronization utility for Windows Mobile (formerly known as
      Pocket Mobile, before that as Pocket PC and before that as
      Windows CE).</p>
      <p>Palm OS was originally developed by a division of the Tandy
      Corporation (then RadioShack), which was an IBM clone with a
      touch sensitive display in 1989. The division of Tandy
      Corporation became Palm Computing in 1992. Around 1995 USRobotics
      acquired Palm as a subsidiary, which was later acquired by 3Com.
      Palm became an independent company again years later and some of
      the developers formed Handspring. Palm and Handspring were part
      of the original developing team behind the operating systems.
      Both Palm and Handspring promoted the development and marketing
      of software and compatible hardware. To make the relation of that
      these two companies have with each other more confusing, Palm
      acquired Handspring in 2003 giving the OS new life under the name
      PalmOne, which was later dropped in favor of the original name,
      Palm.</p>
      <p>With the changes in the Palm OS 4 and 5, some vendors were
      forced to change hardware configurations. One of these vendors
      was Handspring, which dropped Springboard modules from their
      newer models. These modules were interchangeable units that gave
      extra functions to Handspring units like dictionaries,
      encyclopedias, audio recorders, modems, cameras and even a mobile
      phone named Visorphone.</p>

      <h2 id="Installation">Installing Palm OS:</h2>
      <p>Unless you are upgrading, there is no access to Palm OS. There
      is no way to format anything. Palm OS devices have no HDD. Palm
      OS is hard-coded to a ROM chip. Operating system upgrades are
      layered on the version of Palm OS that the unit was shipped with.
      Therefore they have to be re-installed if the unit is reset
      (powering the unit completely off).</p>
      <p>If there is no way users (geek or clueless) can install the
      OS, you might wonder why I wrote this in the first place. First,
      clueless end users are dangerous. Some users understand that a
      virus can destroy a system, but they are unwilling to scan a file
      or floppy.</p>
      <p>Second, any unit running any version of Palm OS is the perfect
      way to introduce people to the computer science. The end user has
      nothing to destroy or corrupt. Pressing the reset button on the
      PC will bring the OS back to its proper state.</p>
