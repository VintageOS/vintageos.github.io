    <section role="section">
      <p>KaiOS, founded in 2016, is an <a href="/android.html" target=
      "_self" rel="dofollow" title="What is Android?">Android</a>-based
      operating system developed by American company KaiOS Technologies
      (offices in Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, India, Brazil and France)
      for feature phones (not smart phones, but rather semi-smart
      <em>dumb</em> phones) forked from the defunct Firefox OS
      (2013-16). Firefox OS was planned to compete against <a href=
      "/android.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "Android">Android</a> (not necessarily <a href="/ios.html"
      target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What is iPhone OS (iOS)?">iOS</a>) on smart phones and other
      smart devices including television sets. Unfortunately, Firefox
      OS was not well received by developers leading to its demise.</p>

      <p>KaiOS took the Firefox OS (forked as Boot to Gecko OS or B2G
      OS, defunct as of 2017) code and modified it for feature phones —
      usually with a 1.1 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon microprocessor, small
      internal storage (2.37 GB of about 4 GB used by the built-in
      apps), 512 MB of RAM, a slot for external storage (microSD) up to
      32 GB, Bluetooth access, no keyboard, no touchscreen (usually the
      most expensive component in a smart phone), clam-shell (flip
      phone) with a 320x240 LCD screen (QVGA, 262,144 colors) and
      usually a low quality (2 MP) camera.</p>
      <p>Note that Firefox OS and now KaiOS boot directly to Gecko
      (Firefox). Therefore apps for KaiOS are coded in HTML5, CCS3 and
      JavaScript using Mozilla's WebIDE. This allows them to run on
      inexpensive hardware (that would not break easily and hence
      fairly affordable) capable of running on 2G and 4G at a fraction
      of the cost thanks to lower bandwidth and battery consumption
      (about 390 minutes of talk time and 300 hours of stand-by).</p>
      <p>Although third-party are apps (usually not part of the OS) are
      browser-based, some of apps can run offline (no feeds or hosted
      apps). The only difference is that theKaiOS single image
      advertisement (KaiAds) that runs at the start of these apps fails
      to run (not cached). By the way, the web browser app is simply
      labeled as <tt>Browser</tt> (extremely original).</p>
      <p>There are several companies that are working with and/or have
      invested over $50 million in KaiOS (as of 05/2019) including
      Google with an investment of $22 million, which has also supplied
      compatible versions of Google Search, Google Assistant (speech
      recognition rather than using a keypad) and Google Maps. It is
      interesting that Google is helping the competition or trying to
      secure a position in the feature phone market — a different
      subset of the mobile market.</p>
      <p>KaiOS has become a hit in developing countries especially in
      Asia and Africa bringing internet access to over 100 million
      current (as of 05/2019) and potential customers who cannot afford
      a smart phone. Having an app store or repository (KaiStore)
      offering Facebook's WhatsApp (communication service of choice in
      most of Asia and Africa) has helped too.</p>
      <p>In India, Jio has invested $7 million and uses KaiOS for their
      mobile phones — branded as JioPhone (about $25 with a keypad only
      or $45 with a QWERTY keyboard) with its own version of the app
      store (Jio Store). Needless to say, hackers have found a way to
      install and run the KaiStore on any JioPhone.</p>
      <p>In North America, the selection of KaiOS mobile phones is
      extremely limited. Some feature phones running KaiOS, although
      not advertised as such, are targeted to the elderly and start at
      about <a href="https://amzn.to/2ZAeKII" target="_blank" rel=
      "nofollow" title="Alcatel A405DL">$20</a> (<a href=
      "https://amzn.to/2ZAeKII" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=
      "Alcatel A405DL">$10</a> if refurbished as of 09/2020). The best
      feature phones running KaiOS in the North American market is the
      Nokia 8110 4G (nicknamed <em>the banana phone</em>) with a retail
      price of <a href="https://amzn.to/2NFjVVu" target="_blank" rel=
      "nofollow" title="Nokia 8110 4G">$70</a> with a keypad only.</p>
      <p>KaiOS currently holds a large (if not the largest) piece of
      the feature phone market share and can possibly become the leader
      in this technology in developing countries.</p>
      <p>I could not convince KaiOS to give a free unit from any vendor
      to test the OS so I had to buy an <a href=
      "https://amzn.to/2ZAeKII" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=
      "Alcatel A405DL">Alcatel A405DL</a> running KaiOS 2.5 for
      <a href="https://amzn.to/2ZAeKII" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
      title="Alcatel A405DL">$20</a> (no service, 802.11 only)

       to test this OS. By the way, to no one's surprise the customer
      support staff had no idea what KaiOS is. Maybe KaiOS Technologies
      should advertise their OS in the US. Maybe this way users can ask
      for KaiOS when buying feature phones instead of simply buying
      cheap mobile phones with some proprietary OS that no one has ever
      heard of before. Hence they could provide KaiOS on more units in
      the US as an alternative to <a href="/ios.html" target="_self"

      <p>Note that KaiOS does not save files to microSD and the OS does
      not seem to give any means to change the default path. It seems
      that access to microSD is for users to save and/or move pictures,
      videos, music and other personal files between the internal and
      external storage rather than writing to it.</p>
      <p>The unit comes with built-in apps.</p>

      <p>I am excited to test KaiOS 2.5 although it was released in
      02/2018. As of 08/2019 (when I tested it), the latest version was
      KaiOS 2.6, which was released in 05/2019.</p>
      <p>One thing that I have noticed so far is that the version of
      KaiStore does not offer the same apps advertised in other
      countries like Google Assistant or other Google apps or services
      for the feature phone that I bought. According to KaiOS the
      selection of apps depends on the sole decision and selection of
      the vendor and/or carrier — in my case, <a href=
      "https://amzn.to/2ZAeKII" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=
      "Alcatel A405DL">Alcatel A405DL</a>. This selection is fairly
      poor compared to the selection from vendors abroad, for example,
      JioPhone (India).</p>
      <p>Audio is recorded in either at 8 KHz or 44 KHz (CD quality)
      sample rate <tt>.RCD</tt>. The naming convention is basically the
      timestamp with format <tt>yyyy-mm-dd_HHmmss</tt> (for example,
      <tt>record_20190904_172958.rcd</tt>).</p>
      <p>The naming convention of the 320x240 pictures (only portrait,
      not landscape) is fairly annoying where the prefix <tt>IMG_</tt>
      comes before an incremental integer from <tt>0001</tt>
      (<tt>IMG_0001.jpg</tt>) to <tt>9999</tt> (<tt>IMG_9999.jpg</tt>)
      — in other words, no timestamp. At least, screenshots (camera key
      and volume down) have a different naming convention that includes
      the timestamp with format <tt>yyyy-MM-dd-HH-mm-ss</tt> (for
      example, <tt>2019-09-04-17-29-58.png</tt>).</p>
      <p>Videos are recorded in 320x240 <tt>.GPP</tt> and saved with
      the same naming convention as pictures starting with the suffix
      <tt>VID_</tt> instead of <tt>IMG_</tt> — in other words, just as
      annoying.</p>
      <p>Other than my complaint about pictures (not screenshots), I
      can even read my email on <tt>Browser</tt>. I could not get the
      <tt>E-Mail</tt> app to work with Gmail maybe because of the
      account security.</p>

      <p>One little issue that drives me crazy accessing my email in
      <tt>Browser</tt> is to authenticating much too often. I
      understand having to log in to 802.11 every time I move from one
      network to another (home to work and vice versa).</p>
      <p>From what I can see so far, the mobile phone that I bought
      (<a href="https://amzn.to/2ZAeKII" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
      title="Alcatel A405DL">Alcatel A405DL</a> for <a href=
      "https://amzn.to/2ZAeKII" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=
      "Alcatel A405DL">$20</a>) to test KaiOS 2.5 can play
      <tt>.MP3</tt> (music), <tt>.OOG</tt> (music), <tt>.MP4</tt>
      (videos), <tt>.GPP</tt> (videos), <tt>.OGV</tt> (videos),
      <tt>.GPP</tt> (videos), <tt>.JPEG</tt> (photos), <tt>.BMP</tt>
      (images) and <tt>.TXT</tt> (texts) file types.</p>
      <p>Maybe I am too much of a nerd, but I really like KaiOS 2.5 and
      my <a href="https://amzn.to/2ZAeKII" target="_blank" rel=
      "nofollow" title="Alcatel A405DL">$20</a> <a href=
      "https://amzn.to/2ZAeKII" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=
      "Alcatel A405DL">Alcatel A405DL</a>. By the way, if anyone wants
      to know why I get so excited about this technology, I like old
      technology. It has a <em>retro</em> look and feel.</p>
      <p>The problem that I have seen since I started playing with
      KaiOS is that it seems that whatever enthusiasm there was with
      feature phones in the United States has died off. There are also
      much fewer videos and articles on-line about this feature phones
      and therefore OSs like KaiOS although there seems to be a small
      cult following. Even the fact that feature phones can be
      untraceable if set correctly has not caught the attention of
      those who are direly concerned about privacy. Then again, KaiOS
      fulfills a need — giving an inexpensive means communication
      especially internet to people in developing countries.</p>
    </section>
    <section role="section">
      <h2 id="Obsolete">Four Years Later</h2>
      <p>Before I start this section, I must indicate that the version
      of KaiOS that my feature phone has is 2.5 (11/2017) and the
      newest version is 3.1 (03/2022). My KaiOS 2.5 phone is beyond
      obsolete. At this point, the phone is useless aside from being
      able to make and receive calls as well as being able to play some
      games (mostly clones of known games). I guess it is now a totally
      <em>dumb</em> phone with a built-in FM radio receiver, video
      player, video/photo camera and MP3 player.</p>
      <p>After four years of knowing about KaiOS for the first time, I
      still do not see an American market although it might have never
      planned by the developers and feature phone manufacturers. I
      still believe there is a market in the United States aiming to
      the elderly as an alternative to other vendors in the market that
      specializes in big-button phones.</p>
      <p>At the same time, application development for KaiOS has been
      web-based by design. These applications no longer run properly as
      many websites like Google (no AMP support as the Motorola Razr V3
      had, 2004) GMail, Yahoo. ProtonMail and others will not work in
      the built-in web browser (<tt>Browser</tt>). It almost feels like
      OS and application development has been abandoned — perhaps as a
      result of applications prior to v3.0 (09/2021) becoming useless
      with major changes in the OS or programmers simply losing
      interest. Maybe abroad this technology does much better than it
      has ever done in the United States regardless of application
      development.</p>
      <p>I cannot feel anything, but disappointment. I rooted for KaiOS
      to become the next big breakthrough in technology for portable
      devices or, at least, phones like <a href="/ios.html" target=
      "_self" rel="dofollow" title="What is iPhone OS (iOS)?">iOS</a>
      (06/2007) and <a href="/android.html" target="_self" rel=
      "dofollow" title="What is Android?">Android</a> (09/2008).</p>
      <p>Considering the changes that KaiOS has gone through as of
      02/2023, I am shocked that some applications still work.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1.0 (03/2017) — First KaiOS smart feature flip phone</li>
        <li>2.0 (07/2017) — Major core upgrade to Gecko 48</li>
        <li>2.5.0 (11/2017) — Services and third party apps</li>
        <li>2.5.1 (07/2018) — KaiStore, KaiAccount, and advanced
        features, WhatsApp</li>
        <li>2.5.1.1 (09/2018) — Minor system updates</li>
        <li>2.5.2 (12/2018) — KaiAds and SIM-based cust.</li>
        <li>2.5.3 (07/2019) — Major service upgrades, location service
        enhancement</li>
        <li>2.5.3.1 (02/2020) — Minor system updates, notification
        enhancement</li>
        <li>2.5.3.2 (05/2020) — Device Financing Program, Dual SIM LTE
        support</li>
        <li>2.5.4 (08/2020) — LF 1.6 integration, North America
        requirement</li>
        <li>3.0 (09/2021) — Major platform Upgrade, Gecko upgrade from
        version 48 (2016) to version 84 (12/2020).<br>
        Older apps no longer work without the developer adapting to
        this OS version and publish an update to the store. WhatsApp
        not available anymore for KaiOS v3.</li>
        <li>3.1 (03/2022) — Minor system updates</li>
      </ul>

      <p>At this point, I do not know if I should give KaiOS another
      shot. At least, KaiOS remains as a pet project that I like even
      if the market does not seem to care about it.</p>
