      <h1 id="main">What is Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)?</h1>
      <p>There are two parts to this concept of FOSS. The term
      <em>free</em> involves no monetary compensation for the software
      or product. The term <em><a href="https://opensource.org/"
      target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=
      "Open Source Initiative">open source</a></em> (or simply referred
      to as <em>"<a href="https://opensource.org/" target="_blank" rel=
      "nofollow" title="Open Source Initiative">open</a>"</em>)
      indicates that the source code for specific programs (OSs,
      servers, databases, etc.) is available to the public, that anyone
      may alter the source code, but must submit the new source code
      back to the community and especially to the owner(s) of the
      project, yet regulated by any of various umbrella licenses to
      protect the project and everyone involved in the development or
      use of the program(s) — hence open, not restricted. Visit
      <a href="https://opensource.org/docs/osd" target="_blank" rel=
      "nofollow" title=

      <p>The social benefit of any open project is that many developers
      may write (code) or fix specific sections of the source code.
      Working as a community, no single developer owns it, but each
      receives credit for being part of such project. At the same time,
      these projects are free of charge to users, who often willingly
      supply feedback and submit information on bugs on the
      functionality of the program(s). In general, for almost every
      commercial program, there is an open and royalty-free
      alternative. The biggest examples nowadays are the various
      flavors of <a href="/linux.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow"
      title="What is Linux?">Linux</a> and <a href="/bsd.html" target=
      "_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What is Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD)?">BSD</a> — most
      likely in this order.</p>
      <p>The drawback of some open source projects is that there can be
      little support by the developer(s) for any number of reasons,
      which normally narrow down to lack resources — much too often
      time and/or money. Nonetheless other users are more than willing
      to help.</p>
      <p>At the same time, big projects like MySQL (currently owned by
      Oracle) make a revenue offering technical support (service model)
      although the product itself is free of charge. In other cases,
      third-parties offer commercial support for products like Apache.
      Of course, there is vast on-line and/or printed documentation and
      literature on these projects.</p>
      <p>In the other hand, we can use the term <em>"closed"</em> when
      referring to proprietary code, not available to the public,
      regulated and limited by legalities whether the program is free
      of charge or not. Understanding the latter, closed programs can
      either be given to the public free of charge (freeware), included
      in open source projects, offered as a commercial product or
      marketed in any possible way or combination of ways including as
      shareware at the sole discretion of the developer(s). In this
      case, there is more support alternatives from the vendor(s) and
      third-parties.</p>
      <p>I support open source as an extension of the hacker mentality
      and its rebellious and anti-establishment spirit (similar to that
      of punk rock of the 1970s), which offers free of charge
      alternatives to commercialism, big corporations (somehow IBM not
      often included), proprietary code technologies and the <em>status
      quo</em> in general. As I have mentioned in other sections of
      <a href="/" target="_self" rel="nofollow" title=
      "What is an operating system (OS)?">VintageOS</a>, I currently
      use <a href="/chromeos.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What is chromeOS?">Chromebook</a> as well as <a href=
      "/linux.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What is Linux?">Linux</a> and <a href="/android.html" target=
      "_self" rel="dofollow" title="Android">Android</a>. Needless to
      say, I am more familiar with open standards. Unfortunately this,
      by no means, makes me an expert on any of these technologies
      (<a href="/disclaimer.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What is the disclaimer (my rights)?">disclaimer</a>). It just
      makes me dangerous as I like to experiment and often end up
      breaking things.</p>
      <p>In the late 1990s, FOSS became the movement against <a href=
      "/windows.html" target="_self" rel="dofollow" title=
      "What is Microsoft Windows?">Windows</a>, Microsoft and Bill
      Gates. Although this was the wrong attitude to engage, this is
      what got me into <a href="/linux.html" target="_self" rel=
      "dofollow" title="What is Linux?">RedHat 5.2</a>.</p>
